# Collision sphere models — `BASECOL.DAT` and `.COL`

The hit geometry a shot is tested against for a structure, a HERC or a flyer. DBSIM never tests a shot against a unit's polygons. Reverse-engineered from `DBSIM.EXE` (Ghidra project `ES2Recon`); addresses are DBSIM virtual addresses. The test that walks this model, and what it does with the result, is [`../simulation/hit-detection.md`](../simulation/hit-detection.md#the-test--mech_selectstruckcomponent-0040c9d4).

## Layout

One format, two sources. Every field is `int16`, with no header and no padding:

```
nodeCount
  per node: nodeIndex, clusterCount
    per cluster: componentIndex, sphereCount, sphereCount * { x, y, z, radius }
```

- **Structures** read 65 of these back to back out of `dat\BASECOL.DAT`, in `BASES.DAT` type order, as one continuous stream partway through `Base_LoadResources` (`00405fac`). `componentIndex` indexes the type's `BASES.DAT` component array ([`bases-dat.md`](bases-dat.md#the-component-record-30-bytes)).
- **Mechs and flyers** each read one whole file, `col\<NAME>.COL`, through `Collision_RegisterObject` (`0040cd88`), which files each model in a fixed table (`CollisionTable_Array`, `004a98a8`, 6 bytes an entry, count at `004987de`) — the mech from `Mech_Constructor` (`00415bb0`, into `mech+0x1f6`), the flyer from its type loader (`FlyerType_LoadResources` (`00422ed0`), into `flyerTypeRec+0x32`). `componentIndex` indexes the `.DMG` file's 29-slot component array instead ([`../simulation/component-damage.md`](../simulation/component-damage.md#the-component-damage-system)).

`nodeIndex` is `-1` for the object's own frame; anything else is a shape part id, resolved at test time ([`../simulation/hit-detection.md`](../simulation/hit-detection.md#the-test--mech_selectstruckcomponent-0040c9d4)).

Readers: `Collision_LoadRecordArray` (`0040ccf8`) → `Collision_ReadNode` (`0040cc50`) → `Collision_ReadCluster` (`0040cc14`) → `Collision_ReadSphereArray` (`0040c7c4`). The field order inside a cluster is not the struct order: `componentIndex` lands at the record's `+6` and is read first, `sphereCount` lands at `+0` and is read second, because the two live in different functions. `sphereCount` is tested as `value & 0x1fff` but allocated and read unmasked — the mask is only a zero-test, and no retail record sets the top bits.

**They really are spheres.** `Collision_ReadSphereArray` allocates elements of 8 bytes, `Collision_ClusterSphereTest` (`0040c524`) strides four `int16` per element and passes index 3 to `Collision_RaySphereTest` (`0040c428`) as a single scalar radius applied radially about the ray, and `Collision_ComputeBoundingSphere` (`0040c5d0`) inflates each child by that one radius on all three axes. Nothing compares per-axis extents.

## Not on disk

Each cluster's bounding sphere is built at load by `Collision_ComputeBoundingSphere` (`0040c5d0`) as the AABB of the children each inflated by its own radius, centred on that box's midpoint, radius = `Math_FastMagnitude3D` of the half-extents. That approximation is direction-dependent, from about 8% under to about 9% over a true Euclidean radius depending on the box's proportions ([`../simulation/dbsim-physics-notes.md`](../simulation/dbsim-physics-notes.md#fixed-point-math-toolkit)), so the bound is not exactly circumscribing; it is behaviour, not an artefact. The hit test rejects on it before touching any child sphere, and the mech component-position lookup reads its centre ([`../simulation/damage-system.md`](../simulation/damage-system.md#where-a-component-stands--the-0x58-slot)).

## Verified against retail data

**`BASECOL.DAT`** is 4,938 content bytes; the walk lands exactly on the end after 65 types. Every cluster's `componentIndex` is inside its type's component array. The geometry reads as deliberate hitboxes — a three-section bunker with a cluster per section, a gun tower with a cluster per barrel. One type (3) carries a full model that its `BASES.DAT +0x30` flag leaves switched off.

**The 22 `.COL` files** likewise walk exactly to their own end and round-trip byte-exact. Every `componentIndex` is inside the 29-slot array (max 28); every node id resolves to a real shape part except RAZOR's single node 5, which the hit test gives an identity transform. Node counts run 1 (RAZOR, SKIMMER) to 13 (SPIDER); sphere radii 40–600 world units. `SKIMMER` is the only file with an object-frame cluster.

ACHILLES' first cluster cross-checks against its `.DMG`: it places spheres for components 7, 9 and 11 on nodes 3 and 1, and 7→9→11 is exactly the parent chain that file states for the left leg ([`dmg-damage-file.md`](dmg-damage-file.md#the-piece-record), `+0x04`). Component 7's two spheres are `(-20, 0, -100) r=200` and `(-20, 0, -400) r=180` — a thigh as two stacked balls.

## Rejected readings

| Reading | Why it is wrong |
|---|---|
| A `.COL` file is a 10-byte header followed by unparsed data | There is no header. The five shorts read as one are the walk's first five fields: "always 6" is ACHILLES' node count (MONGOOSE has 8, PITBULL 10, SPIDER 13, RAZOR and SKIMMER 1), "always 3 for hercs, `FFFF` for skimmer" is the first node's index (SPIDER's is 12, and `FFFF` is the object frame), a "collider type" that crashes above 1 is the first node's cluster count reading past the end of the file, "hercs have 7" is the first cluster's component index (component 7 is `LEG/LEFT/UPPER`), and the last is that cluster's sphere count |
