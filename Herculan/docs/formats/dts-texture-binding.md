# DTS/DBA texture binding and poly shading

Covers how a `.DTS` poly gets a colour: which `.DBA` is bound to a model, how a textured poly maps its UVs, and how the three untextured poly types resolve their surface value. VSHELL findings are from disassembly of `VSHELL.EXE` in the `ES2Recon` Ghidra project; the shading sections are from `DBSIM.EXE` and are marked as such.

**The `.DTS` format carries no reference to any texture file.** Which `.DBA` is bound to a model is an application-level decision — see "DBA binding" below.

## TSBitmapPart's texture lookup (VSHELL)

Placement, sizing and rotation are in [`dts-billboards.md`](dts-billboards.md). The lookup is a plain frame index into whichever DBA is currently active:

1. `TSShape` carries its bound DBA pointer at `+0x26` (`TSShape_GetBoundBitmapArray`, `0046296d`). The field is the shape's: a `TSShape` is `0x2a` bytes, a `TSShapeInstance` `0xc` (its shape at `+4` and its own copy of the shape's per-sequence frames at `+8`).
2. `g_ActiveBitmapArray` (`DAT_005d8010`) is a process-wide "currently active DBA" global, with two accessors: `TSBase_GetActiveBitmapArray` / `TSBase_SetActiveBitmapArray`.
3. `TSShape_Render` (`00462730`, `TSShape`'s vtable `+0x1c`) and `TSShapeInstance_Render` (`00462894`, `TSShapeInstance`'s, which works on the instance's shape) save the global, swap in the shape's `+0x26`, call `TSPartList_Render` (`0042203a`, which dispatches each child's vtable `+0x1c`), then restore.
4. `TSBitmapPart_Render` (`00421db2`) reads `poly+0x10`, the part's bitmap tag, as a frame index, bounds-checks it against `g_ActiveBitmapArray`'s count, and looks up `*(int*)(*g_ActiveBitmapArray+8) + frameIndex*4`. The part's x and y offsets (`poly+0x12`/`+0x13`, single bytes) place the result.

Resolution is `activeDba.Frames[poly+0x10]`, with no UV interpolation.

## TSTexture4Poly (VSHELL)

### Surface stride

A poly's colour index (`poly+0xc`) is on disk as `surfaceIndex * 4`, so `surfaceIndex = colourIndex / 4`. The front value is the first int32 slot of the group's surface `surfaceIndex`; the back value is the third, 2 slots (8 bytes) later.

Two independent sources agree:

- Raw disassembly of `TSTexture4Poly_Render` (`00422af5`): `MOVZX ESI,word ptr [EBX+0xc]` → `SHL ESI,0x2` → added to `g_ActiveSurfaceRecords` (`DAT_005d88a2`) as a byte offset; front = `*(int32*)(base+offset)`, back = `+8`.
- The file format itself: a group's on-disk colour count is four times its surface count, one per slot of each surface's four `{int16 value, int16 flag}` slots — front fill, front line, back fill, back line.

Related symbols: `TSGroup_RenderPolys` (`00423497`), `TSBSPGroup_Render` (`00423709`, [below](#tsbspgroup-poly-order-vshell)), `g_ActiveSurfaceRecords` (`005d88a2`).

### Render path and UV generation

`g_TexturedPolyUseBitmapBrush` (`00471890`) selects one of two textured fills:

- `== 0` — the only branch that reaches a 3D rasterizer. Builds a per-vertex 3D position array from the group's points and a 4-entry UV-corner array, then calls `TSTexture4Poly_RasterizeA` / `RasterizeB` (`004202dd` / `00420900`), the [screen-linear and perspective-correct fills](#screen-linear-and-perspective-correct-fills).
- `!= 0` — a 2D bitmap fill. It resolves the frame's bitmap through the same pointer-table lookup `TSBitmapPart_Render` uses and installs it in a type-7 bitmap brush, the UVs the bitmap's extent inset by 3 pixels on each side and the remap row chosen by the face's shade. It projects the vertices (`Poly_ProjectShapeVertices`, `0045e694`), clips them to the near plane with their UVs when one fell behind it (`Poly_ClipRingToNearPlaneWithUV`, `0045ee2c`), and fills via `PolyFill_FillThenOutline` (`0045f364`) → `GL_FillPolygon` (`0045f8e7`) / `GL_FillPolygonReversed` (`0045f8d2`). DBSIM has the same branch behind its own `g_TexturedPolyUseBitmapBrush` (`0049f26c`). Both flags are 0 in the images.

The front/back value indexes a **20-byte-stride per-frame descriptor table** reached via `g_ActiveBitmapArray[1]` — one extra pointer dereference from `*g_ActiveBitmapArray`. The first 16 bytes are four `int32` fields `F0..F3`; a 5th field at byte 16 is passed to the rasterizer as a texture-data handle. UV corners, in vertex order:

```
V0 = (F0, F1)
V1 = (F2, F1)
V2 = (F2, F3)
V3 = (F0, F3)
```

from the decompiled assignment sequence `_DAT_0048a190`..`_DAT_0048a1ac` = `F0,F1,F2,F1,F2,F3,F0,F3`. The corners are the descriptor's own. DBSIM builds the descriptors as sub-rectangles of a shared atlas page ([below](#the-frame-descriptor-table-and-the-span-routines-dbsim)); VSHELL's builder is [Open](#open).

A `TSPoly` carries no per-vertex UVs: the frame rect's four corners map to the poly's four corners, and `TSTexture4Poly_Render` hands the rasterizer the whole quad, so one map covers the face.

### Three-vertex texture polys

The name says quad, but 40 `TSTexture4Poly`s across the retail fleet carry **three** vertices, and the original textures them like any other.

There is no vertex-count branch in the UV setup of either binary's render method: both fill all four corners unconditionally and pass the poly's own vertex count on to the rasterizer, which walks the corner array one entry per vertex. Traced in DBSIM — `Raster_SetupTexturedSpan` (`00468078`) steps `param_2 += 2` inside a `param_3`-bounded loop, `param_3` being what `TSTexture4Poly_Render` (`00474e9c`) reads from `poly+8`. A triangle therefore takes `V0`, `V1`, `V2` — the frame's top-left, top-right and bottom-right — and the fourth corner is written but never read.

DBSIM's back-face case swaps positions 1 and 3 and corners 1 and 3 to reverse the winding, which on a triangle touches slot 3 and so cannot apply as written ([Open](#open)).

Over every `dts\*.DTS` the VOLs ship, 3 and 4 are the only vertex counts this type takes. Six each on `APOCA`, `APOC_DEB` and `TOMA_DEB`; three each on `HYPERION` and `HYPE_DEB`; two each on `CERBERUS`, `COLOSSUS`, `COLO_DEB`, `OUTLAW`, `OUTL_DEB`, `SAMSON`, `SAMS_DEB` and `TOMAHAWK`. Every one resolves to an in-range frame of its mech's bank. A count outside `[3, 4]` would run past the exe's own four-corner array, and no retail shape has one.

### Type identification

`TSTexture4Poly` is a mesh poly: it lives in a `TSGroup` and references real 3D vertices through its vertex-list offset and vertex count, structurally unlike `TSBitmapPart`'s 2D quad. It has its own vtable.

- `g_TSObjectTypeRegistry` (`0047f258`, VSHELL) — 18 entries, 12-byte stride, each `{tag:uint32, constructorFnPtr, nameStringPtr}`. `tag` matches an object's on-disk chunk header, `[subtype:u16][supertype:u16]` (e.g. `0x0014000f` = `TSTexture4Poly`).
- `TSTexture4Poly_Construct` (`0045ffe0`) stamps the vtable of each level of the class's inheritance chain in turn as the inlined constructors run, finishing with `g_TSTexture4PolyVtable` (`0047ee0c`).
- Slot `+0x1c` of that vtable is `TSTexture4Poly_Render` (`00422af5`), which:
- reads `poly+0xc`, the colour index, as an index into the per-surface runtime record array (`DAT_005d88a2`, 4-byte stride);
- runs `TSPoly_FrontBackVisibilityTest` (`0045e480`) on the points `poly+4`/`poly+6` index (`TSPoly.Normal`/`Center`), and a positive result picks the front colour pair ([below](#tspoly_frontbackvisibilitytest));
- resolves the descriptor at `DAT_005d8010[1] + idx*0x14`;
- builds world-space positions for all `poly+8` vertices;
- derives UV corners from the descriptor's own fields, not from per-vertex file data (`TSPoly` carries no on-disk UV fields);
- calls the rasterizers, which do per-edge clipping, fixed-point interpolation of screen position plus a 4th interpolant across spans, and per-pixel inner-loop draws.

RTTI type-name strings are unreferenced in this binary; the type registry is the reliable route to a constructor. See `project_es2_exe_recon` for the same dead end on `.BND`/`MECH`.

## DBA binding

Which `.DBA` a model gets is not in the `.DTS`.

VSHELL's `dba\rpr_<code>.dba`, `dba\<code>_int.dba`, `_bod`/`_wep`/`_out` are 2D Herc-display UI graphics, not mesh textures. In-game mech body textures are shared atlases in `simvol0/dba/`: `LIGHT`, `MEDIUM`, `HEAVY` (weight class), `ENEMY`, `NEWHERCS`, `APOCATEX`, `RAZORTEX`.

### DBSIM's mech-to-texture mapping

`MechType_InitOne` (`004201a8`) sets each root shape's `TSShape+0x26` to `&g_MechTextureGroupSlots + typeRecord[0x96]*8`. `g_MechTextureGroupSlots` (`004a9df6`) is an 8-byte-stride array, one slot per texture group. `typeRecord+0x96` is the mech type record's texture group, record offset 148 ([`mech-locomotion.md`](../simulation/mech-locomotion.md#mech-type-record)).

Byte-verified against every `simvol0/dat/*.DAT` (226 bytes each: 9-byte VOL prefix + 216-byte content + 1 trailer, matching the function's `0xd8` = 216-byte read):

| Record offset 148 | Group | Mechs |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | light | OUTLAW |
| 1 | medium | TOMAHAWK |
| 2 | heavy | SAMSON, COLOSSUS |
| 3 | enemy | DIABLO, CERBERUS, HYPERION, MIRIMAC, MONGOOSE, HEADHUNT, PITBULL, ACHILLES, RAMSES, SCARAB, STINGRAY, SPIDER |
| 4 | apocatex | APOCA |
| 5 | razortex | RAZOR |
| 6 | newhercs | OGRE, MAVERICK, RAPTOR2 |

### The flyers' bank

Every flyer chassis shares **one** bank, and it is group 3's `ENEMY`, the Cybrid mechs' own. `FlyerType_LoadResources` (`00422ed0`) writes the literal slot address `0x004a9e0e` into the shape's `+0x26`, which is `g_MechTextureGroupSlots` (`004a9df6`) plus `3 * 8` — there is no per-chassis choice, which fits a roster that is entirely Cybrid.

### Fleet audit

Every `dts\*.DTS` with a matching `dat\*.DAT`, 22 mechs:

- **21 of 22 have no out-of-range texture polys** — every front value of surface `colourIndex / 4` lands inside the selected bank's frame count. Across ~2000 polys, a wrong stride or a wrong bank mapping would produce out-of-range indices.
- **TOMAHAWK has 4 anomalous polys**, all identical: colour index 0 into a 1-entry surface array whose front and back values are both 3084 (`0xC0C`) against a 36-frame bank. Reads as a degenerate group in the source art.
- **Three-vertex texture polys resolve too**, on the same corner order as quads — see [Three-vertex texture polys](#three-vertex-texture-polys).

### Coincident twins

Real DTS meshes stack a textured poly exactly on top of a flat-shaded twin — 186 such pairs in SAMSON's first root.

### Cutout frames

`BASETEX` frames 11, 36, 38, 39, 52, 53, 60, 61 and 63-65 are 20-73% palette index 0 each: the lattice girders on a structure's support towers, which show sky through the frame. Mech skins carry a handful of stray index-0 texels that are paint, not cutouts (9 of 44376 in `LIGHT`, 7 of 68464 in `MEDIUM`).

## Poly types and their colour mechanisms (DBSIM.EXE)

DBSIM's DTS type registry (`g_TSObjectTypeRegistry`, `004a63c8` — 12-byte `{tag, ctor, name}` entries keyed by the on-disk chunk marker) identifies a shape object's class by construction. Use it, not structural resemblance to VSHELL's renderers.

| Tag | Type | Vtable | Render (`+0x1c`) | Surface value means |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00140002` | `TSSolidPoly` | `004a5ef8` | `00474db4` | palette index |
| `0x00140003` | `TSShadedPoly` | `004a6000` | `0047542c` | shade-ramp number |
| `0x00140009` | `TSGouraudPoly` | `004a5fd4` | `004755c8` | shade-ramp number |
| `0x0014000f` | `TSTexture4Poly` | `004a5f24` | `00474e9c` | `.DBA` frame index |

The four are different mechanisms. Only `TSTexture4Poly` samples a bitmap.

The group's surface array is read raw (`TSGroup_ReadFromStream`, `0048e8e4`), so a renderer's surface value is the file's own `{int16 colour, int16 flag}` pair packed into one int32, flag in the high half. A pair with `0x14` in the top byte means "do not draw this face"; retail uses it on back pairs only (flag 5120, against 1024 on the front). **This is the format's back-face culling**, and most of the fleet relies on it: back pairs flagged 5120 are 790 of 998 polys in `SAMSON.DTS`, 2122 of 2202 in `BASES_AN.DTS`, and 5090 of 6988 in `MECHWPNS.DTS`. The rest are genuinely two-sided.

Retail usage counts: `TSSolidPoly` is rare — 12 polys in `BULLETS.DTS`, 57 in `ROCKETS.DTS`, 73 across the whole mech and building fleet. `TSShadedPoly` is nearly everything else: 1227 of APOCA's 1368 polys, 2049 of `BASES_AN`'s.

### `TSSolidPoly` — palette index, unlit, fill plus outline

`TSSolidPoly_Render` (`00474db4`) computes no light term and resolves **two** colours per face:

```
pick front pair (surface[0]=Front, surface[1]=FrontLine) or back pair ([2]/[3]) by visibility
skip if both have 0x14 in the top byte
row  = Raster_ShadeRampRow(0x80)        // the fixed unlit row; no light term is ever computed
fill = row[Front];  line = row[FrontLine]
PolyFill_FillThenOutline (0048d518) -> fill the polygon, then when line != fill re-draw it in `line`
```

The second pass is the rasterizer's **mode 4**, which `Raster_DrawPolygonDispatch` (`00483dac`)'s `iVar11 == 4` branch walks as a line loop over the poly's own vertex list, closing back to the first vertex — an outline, not a second fill. The `line != fill` test is on the **ramped** bytes, so two surface values that resolve to the same ramp output draw no outline.

**A two-vertex `TSSolidPoly` is a line, not a degenerate face.** `MECHWPNS.DTS` carries 92 of them and `SAMSON.DTS` none; a Particle Beam Weapon's four struts between housing and barrel are the visible case (`Reference/PBW_Comparison.png`). The fill pass has no area, so the outline is the whole of what they draw, in the surface's line colour — palette 198, `#5C5C5C`, on every one of them. Ten more carry a single vertex, which the original paints as one pixel.

`DAT_006c60d8`/`DAT_006c60dc` are one **brush** — `{mode, colour}` — and the default one: the fill dispatches on whatever `clipBlock+0x228` points at, which is normally this pair. A caller that installs a brush of its own there instead leaves these writes inert; the beam draw is the one that does, see [`../simulation/beam-visuals.md`](../simulation/beam-visuals.md#beamdats-colour-index-is-the-fill-brush-and-only-the-jagged-path-uses-it). `DAT_006c60d4`, the line colour, sits just below it and is not part of the brush.

Across all 55 retail `.DTS`, 11 roots carry a surface whose line colour differs from its fill: `BULLETS.DTS` root 4 (ATC35), five weapon-model roots in `MECHWPNS`/`MECHWPN2`, and 3-edge slivers on two `HYPERION` LODs and one `MIRIMAC` root. ATC35's three quads are gold `#D0CC3C` with no outline, `#ECCCAC` outlined `#E4E4E4`, and `#DCCCA0` outlined `#D8D4D4`.

Corroboration that the value is a palette index: of the 1517 plain `TSSolidPoly` surfaces across every retail `.DTS`, **all 1517** carry a zero flag and a value inside 0-255 — no distribution that tight is a per-shape frame index. The projectiles make it visible: their values are 85, 93, 94, 104 and 246 — the fire ramp and near-white — and none is a valid frame of the eight-frame `BULLETS.DBA`.

### `TSShadedPoly` — shade-ramp number, per-face light, fixed `.RMP` row

`TSShadedPoly_Render` (`0047542c`) resolves a face's colour in two lookups, and the same pair again for the line colour:

```
shade        = Light_ComputeShadeForFace(normal, center)     // 0048bedc, 0..255
paletteIndex = Palette_ShadeRampLookup(surface.Front, shade) // 00430e34
byte         = Raster_ShadeRampRow(0x80)[paletteIndex]       // 00468054, the FIXED unlit row
```

All of a shaded face's lighting is in the first lookup; the `.RMP` row is the same literal `0x80` the unlit solid renderer passes and never varies with light.

`Palette_ShadeRampLookup` (`00430e34`):

```
idx = value & 0xff;  if (idx >= ActivePalette.rampCount) idx = 0;
pos = Q8Multiply(shade, ramp[idx].length);
if (pos == ramp[idx].length) pos = ramp[idx].length - 1;
return ramp[idx].indices[pos];
```

The surface value names a *material*; the light level picks a step along that material's brightness sequence.

### `TSGouraudPoly` — same ramp number, per-vertex light, no `.RMP` row

`TSGouraudPoly_Render` (`004755c8`; its tag function `TSGouraudPoly_GetClassTag` (`0048e450`) returns `0x140009`) shares the surface-pair selection and the light function, and differs in both of the things that decide a pixel:

```
for each vertex i:
    shades[i] = Light_ComputeShadeForFace(points[normalList[i]], points[vertexList[i]])
DAT_006c60e4 = shades;  DAT_006c60d8 = 1;      // fill mode 1: interpolate the shade
PolyFill_FillThenOutline(...)
```

- The shade is computed **per vertex**, walking the normal list and the vertex list in step, and interpolated by the span routine.
- **`Raster_ShadeRampRow` is never called.** The ramp lookup moves into the span so it can vary per pixel; the fixed `.RMP` row is not part of this path. A Gouraud surface's colour is the material ramp's entry straight through the palette.

Distinguishing evidence: the `.RMP` row shifts every ramp entry down one step and collapses two pairs, so for `WORLD2`'s ramp 8 the shaded chain can never emit palette 178 (`#68687c`). A retail capture of the ramp-8 cylindrical structure (`Reference/Gouraud_shading_comparison.png`) shows `#9090a4 #848498 #7c7c90 #707084 #68687c #606074 #545468 #4c4c60 #444454 #3c3c4c #343444` — a consecutive run of the **raw** ramp entries, `#68687c` included. Neither the fixed-row chain nor a per-pixel row selected by the interpolated shade contains all eleven.

### `TSTexture4Poly` — frame index, ramp row by light, fullbright on demand

`TSTexture4Poly_Render` (`00474e9c`) resolves the surface pair the same way the flat types do and spends it as a **`.DBA` frame index**: the frame descriptor is `g_CurrentShapeDbaContext[1] + frontValue * 0x14`, and its 5th int32 is the atlas page handle it passes to `Raster_SetupTexturedSpan` (`00468078`), which projects and near-plane-clips the vertices and hands the ring to `Raster_DrawPolygon` (`00468310`), whose span routine samples it. Light enters per pixel through the row selection, not as a multiplier — the span writes `Raster_ShadeRampRow(shade)[texelPaletteIndex]`, so the face's shade picks a row of the theater `.RMP` and the texel picks the column.

**The row count is a switch.** `DAT_004a5b1c` is the `.RMP`'s row count, installed as 32 by `World_LoadTheater` (`0042e010`), and this renderer is its only reader. When it is **zero** the poly is drawn in `Raster_DrawPolygon`'s mode 0 instead: a plain texture copy, with neither a light term nor a ramp lookup, so the texel's palette index reaches the framebuffer unchanged.

Two draws zero it, each for the duration of one object's shape render and restoring it from `DAT_004a5b20` afterwards: `Bullet_Draw` (`0040a120`) and `ObjList_DrawCellObjects` (`00428c60`) around a ground shape's draw ([`../simulation/ground-shapes.md`](../simulation/ground-shapes.md#the-draw-pass)). **That is what makes a round fullbright**, and it is a property of the draw rather than of the shape: the same shape drawn by anything else would be lit. The vtable slot is shared with the launcher rounds, so both classes get it. The one retail projectile shape it reaches is `BULLETS.DTS` root 8, the plasma cannon's round — every other projectile shape is `TSSolidPoly` geometry with no texture to copy; the other textured shape it reaches is the drop pod's square, root 3 of `FLAT2.DTS`.

None of the ramp's own rows is the identity this bypasses: row 0 lands at 0.36x the source colour and row 31 at 1.16x. Skipping the ramp skips the depth bias with it, so a fullbright surface does not fog either.

### The frame descriptor table and the span routines (DBSIM)

`BitmapArray_PackToAtlas` (`00469f38`) turns a loaded `.DBA` into the descriptor table `TSTexture4Poly_Render` reads as `slot[1]`. It packs every frame into 256x256 atlas pages with `Bitmap_PlaceInAtlasPage` (`00469d10`) and returns one 20-byte descriptor per frame. The mech texture groups (`g_MechTextureGroupSlots`), the terrain bank, `WPNTEX`, `BULLETS.DBA` and `BEAMTEX.DBA` are all built this way.

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| `+0x00` | `x0` (int32), the frame's left edge in its atlas page |
| `+0x04` | `y0` (int32) |
| `+0x08` | `x1` (int32), `x0 + width - 1` |
| `+0x0c` | `y1` (int32), `y0 + height - 1` |
| `+0x10` | page index (int16), the texture-data handle the rasterizer takes |
| `+0x12` | int16, 1 when any texel of the frame is palette index 0, else 0 |

`+0x12` is the transparency argument `TSTexture4Poly_Render` passes through `Raster_SetupTexturedSpan` as `Raster_DrawPolygon`'s last parameter, so the colour-key skip is decided per frame at load and a frame with no index 0 draws the same either way.

`Raster_DrawPolygon` (`00468310`) is `(vertexCount, vertices, mode, atlasPage, shadePtr, transparency)`. Its `mode` selects the span routine, and `transparency` selects that routine's opaque or colour-key half:

| mode | span routine | interpolants |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `Raster_SpanTextured` (`0046ab10`) | u, v |
| 1 | `Raster_SpanTexturedShaded` (`0046ac48`) | u, v, and a shade level from `shadePtr` |
| 2 | `Raster_SpanTexturedGouraud` (`0046adad`) | u, v, and a third interpolant at vertex `+0x18`, where `Raster_SetupTexturedSpan` stores it |

Mode 0 with `transparency` zero is the opaque half of `Raster_SpanTextured`: fetch `atlasPage[v][u]`, store that palette byte to the framebuffer, step the fixed-point u and v. The non-zero form skips index 0 as a colour key and does not blend. Nothing in that path applies alpha, a shade level or a colour lookup. The beam draw submits through it: [`../simulation/beam-visuals.md`](../simulation/beam-visuals.md#drawing--beamtracer_draw-0040bc14-vtable-slot-0).

Before the spans, `Raster_ClipPolygonX` (`004698c4`) and `Raster_ClipPolygonY` (`00469b60`) clip the ring to the render context's rect and `Raster_BuildEdgeTables` (`00477c3c`) walks it into per-row left and right edge entries. Each span routine has a twin that draws only a list of visible runs on the row — `Raster_SpanTexturedClipped` (`0048b418`), `Raster_SpanTexturedShadedClipped` (`0048b4a3`), `Raster_SpanTexturedGouraudClipped` (`0048b52e`) — which `Raster_DrawPolygon` uses when `ActiveScanlineClipSpans` is set and either the context's clip mode is 2 or the [depth buffer](#the-depth-buffer) is on.

### Screen-linear and perspective-correct fills

`Raster_DrawPolygon` steps u, v and the ramp row linearly down each edge and across each row, so its texture map is **linear in screen space**. It is the fill `TSTexture4Poly_Render` uses while `g_TexturedPolyPerspective` (`0049f274`) is 0, which is its value in the image, and the one `Terrain_DrawCellQuad` uses for a cell whose nearest corner is at view depth `2 * DAT_0049aad0` or more ([`terrain-drawing.md`](terrain-drawing.md#the-cell-walk--terrain_drawvisiblecells-0046d0a4)).

`Raster_DrawTexturedPolyNear` (`0046865c`) is the **perspective-correct** fill: the nearer terrain cells, and `TSTexture4Poly_Render` when `g_TexturedPolyPerspective` is set. It stores `u/z`, `v/z` and `1/z` per vertex and draws each row in runs of `2^k` pixels, dividing back to u and v at each run's end and stepping linearly inside the run. `k` is 10 when the row's two ends have equal `1/z`, otherwise 4, 5, 6 or 7 as `|Δ(1/z)| >> 12` exceeds 3000, 1000, 300 or none of them. When `g_PerspectiveUseQuadraticFit` (`0049f278`) is set — `Terrain_DrawCellQuad` sets it for a cell whose nearest corner is beyond view depth 25000 — the row's start and its last partial run's end are taken from a quadratic fit that `Raster_BuildEdgeTables` makes through each edge's ends and middle, instead of a divide. Every mode draws with `Raster_SpanTexturedShaded`: mode 1's single ramp row applies, and mode 2's per-vertex row is interpolated down the edges but no span reads it.

VSHELL has the same pair: `TSTexture4Poly_RasterizeA` (`004202dd`) is the screen-linear fill (DBSIM's `Raster_SetupTexturedSpan` and `Raster_DrawPolygon` as one function) and `TSTexture4Poly_RasterizeB` (`00420900`) the perspective-correct one, chosen by `g_TexturedPolyPerspective` (`00471898`). RasterizeB's run thresholds are the globals `DAT_00471980`, `DAT_00471984` and `DAT_00471988`; its `g_PerspectiveUseQuadraticFit` (`0047188c`) is set per cell by `hgrid.cpp`'s cell callback (`00429dac`).

### The depth buffer

When `maybe_g_DepthBufferEnabled` (`0049f270`) is non-zero, `Raster_SetupTexturedSpan` stores each vertex's view depth, and for each row `Raster_DrawPolygon` (and `Raster_DrawTexturedPolyNear`) runs `Raster_DepthTestSpan` (`0048b748`) before drawing. It walks the row's dwords in the buffer at `DAT_006c6014`, comparing each against the interpolated depth with `(row + DAT_004a5b04)` in its top byte; where the stored dword is greater it writes the new value, and the pixels that pass form the row's visible runs. Those runs are drawn through the clipped span routines when `ActiveScanlineClipSpans` is set; otherwise the whole span is drawn. The same flag makes the `TSBSPPart` walk draw the viewer's side of each plane first ([below](#tsbsppart-child-selection)) and the terrain cell walk run near to far ([`../polygon-fill.md`](../polygon-fill.md#walking-a-polygons-cells)). It is 0 in the image; what writes it is [Open](../polygon-fill.md#open).

### The projection, clip and fill chain (DBSIM)

A flat poly is drawn in three steps: project the face's vertices to screen points, clip the ring against the near plane if a vertex fell behind it, and fill the result. The face arrives in globals: `DAT_006c6968` the vertex count, `DAT_006c696a` the offset into the vertex-index list `DAT_006c6976`, and the per-point state byte `DAT_006c697e` (0 untouched, 1 behind the near plane, 2 projected) that memoises a vertex shared between faces. The screen points come out in `DAT_006cbb86`, count `DAT_006cbc86`.

| Function | Does |
|---|---|
| `Poly_ProjectShapeVertices` (`0048c848`) | Projects over the group's 6-byte `int16` point triples at `DAT_006c696c`. Called by `TSSolidPoly_Render`, `TSShadedPoly_Render` and `TSTexture4Poly_Render` |
| `Poly_ProjectIndexedVertices` (`0048c964`) | The same over 12-byte `int32` points at `DAT_006c6970`; returns non-zero when any vertex fell behind the near plane. Called by `BeamTracer_Draw` and by `TexPoly_Render` (`0042ff2d`) |
| `Poly_ClipRingToNearPlane` (`0048ce14`) | Run only when a vertex fell behind the plane: clips the ring and rebuilds the screen-point list. Called by `TSSolidPoly_Render`, `TSShadedPoly_Render` and `BeamTracer_Draw`, among others |
| `PolyFill_Fill` (`0048d4b4`) | Fills the screen polygon through `Raster_DrawPolygonEitherWinding`, then runs `PolyFill_FillThenOutline`'s outline pass without its mode-5 guard |

Both fills' outline pass is gated on the default brush (`DAT_006c60d4 != DAT_006c60dc`) and writes that brush, so a caller that installed its own brush on the context, as the beam draw does, gets an identical flat redraw instead of an outline.

### The `.DPL` shade-ramp table

Immediately after the `colourCount * 4` colour entries. Read byte-complete on all four `WORLD<n>.DPL`:

```
int32  rampCount              // 256 in every retail file
rampCount x {
  int16  length               // retail: 1, 4, 7, 8, 13 or 16
  int16  paletteIndex[length] // darkest to brightest
}
```

Only the low ~19 slots carry real ramps; the rest is the degenerate `[255]`. `WORLD2`: ramp 0 is `196..203` (greys `#484848`..`#d4d4d4`), ramp 8 is `172..187` (blue-greys `#343444`..`#c4c4d4`), ramp 12 is `192..198` (near-black to `#707070`).

Corroboration that the surface value is a ramp number and not a frame index: across the retail fleet shaded-poly surface values cluster on **0-15**, overwhelmingly on the even (multi-step) slots. `APOCA.DTS` uses exactly four values over 1227 polys (12, 2, 0, 8); `SAMSON.DTS` five; `BASES_AN.DTS` nine, topped by 14, 8, 4, 12. A frame index into a 24-to-66-frame bank does not concentrate like that. Colour check: every distinct tone the tall chimney (structure type 14) shows in `Reference/Scramble_Training_Base_2.png` is in the set `WORLD2`'s ramp 8 produces, and its surfaces name ramp 8.

### Two shade calculations — terrain and shapes use different ones

Both walk the active light list. The mission sun is the only entry a mission starts with, and an impact effect can add more ([`effect-lights.md`](effect-lights.md)); for the sun alone both reduce to a function of `facing = -cos` between the surface normal and the direction the light travels (positive = lit). Normals carry length `0x800` and the sun's direction `0x1000`, so the raw dot is `0x800000 * cos`.

| | `Light_ComputeShadeForNormal` (`0048c060`, terrain) | `Light_ComputeShadeForFace` `0048bedc` (shapes) |
|---|---|---|
| gate | `t = dot` | `t = (dot - 0x400000) >> 1` |
| accumulate | `if (t < 0) shade -= (intensity * t) >> 22` | same |
| reduces to | `512 * facing` | `128 + 256 * facing` |
| edge-on (facing 0) | 0 | 128 |
| reaches 0 at | 90 degrees off the light | 120 degrees off |
| saturates at | facing 0.5 | facing 0.496 |

`Light_ComputeShadeForNormal` is what `Terrain_BuildSurface` bakes a cell with; see [`terrain-lighting.md`](terrain-lighting.md). Every poly renderer of a *shape* calls `Light_ComputeShadeForFace`. For a shape the falloff is half as steep, so a curved surface spends its gradient over twice the angular range, and a shadowed side is a mid tone that keeps falling rather than a floor of black.

Intensity scales both terms together (`shade = I * (0.5 + facing)` for the shape curve), so it does not move the zero crossing.

### The sun

One hardcoded directional light per mission, `Light_CreateMissionSun` (`00461240`), intensity `0x100`, direction **(±0.758, -0.359, -0.544)** at length `0x1000` in the sim's Z-up world. No ambient light is created anywhere in the binary. The constants it is built from and the derivation of that direction are in [`terrain-lighting.md`](terrain-lighting.md#the-sun).

### Normals live in the point list

A poly's normal is not a vector stored on the poly. It is a **point index**, and the shape's normals are extra entries in the same `TSGroup.Points` array its corners come from. All flat renderers dereference `TSPoly.Normal` (`poly + 4`) with the 6-byte point stride against the group's point base — `*(ushort *)(poly + 4) * 6 + DAT_006c696c` — and hand it, with the same treatment of `TSPoly.Center` (`poly + 6`), to `TSPoly_FrontBackVisibilityTest`.

A `TSGouraudPoly`'s normal list is the per-vertex form: an offset into the group's **index** array running parallel to the poly's vertex list, whose entries are point indices of normals rather than of corners. `TSGouraudPoly_Render` walks the two lists in step, one light call per vertex.

Verified on `BASES.DGS` shape 11 (structure type 15): every entry the list reaches has length exactly **2048** — the `0x800` the shade calculation is scaled around — and adjacent side panels share the normal at the edge between them.

**Stored normals oppose the corner winding.** For every poly in `BASES.DGS`, `BASES_AN.DTS` and `APOCA.DTS` — 12,656 of them, no exceptions and no intermediate values —

```
dot(normalize(cross(p1 - p0, p2 - p0)), storedNormal) == -1.000
```

so a normal derived from the corner order is the negation of the one the file carries. A renderer must use the stored normal, not the winding: the front/back sign is derived from the poly's normal and then applied to the **corner** normals, which come from this same point list. Mixing the two conventions inverts the light term. It is invisible on a flat poly, where the face and corner normals are the same vector and the sign cancels, and shows up only once per-vertex normals are in use.

### `TSPoly_FrontBackVisibilityTest`

Per **poly**, not per pixel. Takes the poly's own stored normal and centre points and answers "front" for a positive result: with a perspective focal shift it returns `dot(normal, eyeInModelSpace − centre)`, and with a shift of 0 it returns 1 when the normal, rotated into view space, has negative depth. DBSIM's copy is `0048c620`, VSHELL's `0045e480`. When it answers "back", the renderer negates *all* of that poly's normals before lighting them and takes the back surface pair instead of the front.

### `TSBSPPart` child selection

**A `TSBSPPart`'s `Parts` array is a pool its BSP tree indexes into, not a list that is drawn in order.** `TSBSPPart_RenderNode` (`00476a1c`) walks the tree at `part+0x18` (14-byte nodes: an `int16` normal triple, an `int32` coefficient, then a front and a back `int16`), starting at node 0:

```
d = dot(node.normal, viewOrigin) - node.coeff          // node+0x1c names a transform id;
                                                       // -1 means the plane is untransformed
first, second = (d < 0) == maybe_g_DepthBufferEnabled ? (back, front) : (front, back)
for each of first, second:
    if (value < 0)            draw nothing
    else if (value & 0x4000)  render Parts[value & 0x3fff]     // leaf
    else                      recurse into node `value`
```

So a child no node reaches is never drawn, and the tree is what orders back-to-front. Every child of every retail weapon and machine shape checked is reachable, so walking `Parts` in file order happens to agree on retail data — but it is not the rule, and it would diverge on a shape that carried an unreferenced part.

`part+0x1c` is a parallel `int16` per **node**, not per child: the transform whose world matrix the splitting plane is brought into. `Shape_StampTransformId` (`00417530`) stamps a single transform id across all of them when a weapon model is attached to a machine.

### `TSBSPGroup` poly order (VSHELL)

A `TSBSPGroup` is a `TSGroup` with a BSP tree over its own polys. VSHELL's `TSBSPGroup_Render` (`00423709`) sets up as a plain group's render does, then draws through `TSBSPGroup_RenderNode` (`0042362c`) from node 0 instead of walking the polys in order. In the file a node is four `int16`s — plane constant, poly, front, back — and VSHELL walks them as 10-byte records at `group+0x2a` whose constant is an `int32`. The splitting plane is the node poly's own stored normal:

```
d = dot(polys[node.poly].normal, eyeInModelSpace) - node.constant
first, second = d < 0 ? (front, back) : (back, front)
draw first; draw polys[node.poly]; draw second
    child < 0           nothing
    child & 0x4000      polys[child & 0x3fff]
    otherwise           recurse into node `child`
```

So each node's poly is drawn between the two half-spaces it splits, far side first. How DBSIM draws the type is [Open](#open).

## `TSDetailPart` level selection and STRUCTURE DETAIL

`TSDetailPart` is the shape-internal half of DBSIM's LOD system — its parts are one piece of a shape at several levels of detail, and the one drawn is chosen by projected size. `TSDetailPart_Render` (`004768bc`, vtable installed by `FUN_00476834`):

```
size = (radius << DAT_006c60ac) / max(FastMagnitude3D(viewOffset) - radius, 1)   // projected size
if (size == 0) size = 1
t    = Q10Multiply(g_TSDetailPartSizeScaleQ10, size)          // global detail scale, Q10
i    = g_TSDetailPartBias                             // global detail BIAS -- the STRUCTURE DETAIL setting
while (i < count - 1 && details[i] < t) i++
render(parts[min(i - g_TSDetailPartBias, count - 1)])
```

`radius` is the part's own `ClassItem` bounding radius (`part+8`). `viewOffset` is the part's **own node**, not the object's origin: `TSGroup_BindNodeTransform` runs first, and installing the node's transform (`Raster_SetModelTransform` (`0048c338`), or `Raster_RestoreState` (`0048d6e0`) for a node already composed) leaves the camera's position in that node's space in `g_EyeInModelSpace` (`006c60a0`-`a8`), whose length is the node's distance from the camera. `g_TSDetailPartSizeScaleQ10` (`004a1034`) is Q10 one, 1024, in the image ([Open](#open)). Thresholds are walked in file order and the part index is `i - bias`, so:

- `details[]` is ascending and index-aligned with `Parts[]`: **part 0 is the coarsest**, the last is the finest. Retail structure shapes end at 255 (`BASES.DGS` shape 5: `[5, 15, 35, 255]`).
- A **larger** `g_TSDetailPartBias` shifts the whole scale toward the coarse end. At bias 0 a close object reaches `count - 1`.

### Where the bias comes from

`g_TSDetailPartBias` (`004a1038`) is 0 except inside a draw slot that brackets its render with `TSDetailPart_SetBias` (`004768ac`) and a restore to 0:

| Draw slot | Bias pushed |
|---|---|
| `Structure_DrawWithDetailBias` (`004034f4`), slot `+0x00` of all five structure vtables | `g_TSDetailBiasFromStructureDetail` (`004a9638`) |
| `Flyer_Draw` (`004215cc`) | `DAT_004a9e48`, the same value, written beside it |
| `FUN_0040ded8`, slot `+0x00` of the eleven weapon-mount vtables from `00498aa0` and slot `+0x18` of `00499264` | `g_TSDetailBiasFromHercDetail` (`004a98ec`) |
| `Debris_Draw` (`00408e6c`) | the piece's own `+0x50`: 0 from `Debris_Construct`, and `g_TSDetailBiasFromHercDetail` for the gun `WeaponMount_Destroy` throws |

`Bullet_Draw` (`0040a120`), the draw slot of both projectile classes, pushes nothing, so a launcher round's `ROCKETS.DTS` levels are chosen at bias 0 whatever either setting says. A machine's own draw pushes nothing either, and its chassis shapes carry no `TSDetailPart`; its roots are selected one level up ([`mech-shape-drawing.md`](mech-shape-drawing.md#the-lod-root-is-chosen-per-frame-per-object)).

**STRUCTURE DETAIL** reaches the first two rows through `StructureDetail_ApplySetting` (`0045d4f0`), which `Sim_RenderFrame` calls whenever the byte changes and `Sim_InitMissionSession` once at bring-up. Its key table is the identity over the three settings and its values (`g_StructureDetailValues`, `0049f02c`) are `{2, 1, 0}`: LOW is bias 2, MED HIGH 1, MAXIMUM 0. A byte past 2 matches no key and leaves the bias where it was. **HERC DETAIL** reaches the other two through `ShapeDetail_ApplyHercDetailSetting`'s `g_HercDetailTSDetailBiasValues`, `{2, 2, 1, 1, 0}` over its five settings.

Across the retail shape files `TSDetailPart`s sit in the structure libraries (`BASES.DGS`, `BASES_AN.DTS`, `BHULKS.DGS`), the flyer `SKIMMER.DTS`, the weapons (`MECHWPNS.DTS`, `MECHWPN2.DTS`) and `ROCKETS.DTS`. None is nested inside another or inside a `TSCellAnimPart`; cell-animation parts inside a level are common.

Levels are not always the same shape at different densities. `BASES.DGS` shape 10 (structure type 14, the tall chimney) is a 4-sided box with its corners on the world axes at level 0, and an octagon with its *vertices* on the axes at level 1 — a 45-degree difference in cross-section.

## Rejected readings

Readings a fresh pass could land on. Each is disproven; do not reintroduce.

| Reading | Why it is wrong |
|---|---|
| `g_TexturedPolyUseBitmapBrush` selects a flat, untextured fallback that resolves the frame only for its bounds-check assert | The resolved bitmap is the fill: the branch installs it, with UVs and a remap row, in a type-7 bitmap brush before calling the same fill chain `TSSolidPoly_Render` uses, and restores the default colour brush after. See [Render path and UV generation](#render-path-and-uv-generation) |
| `00474e9c` is `TSSolidPoly_Render` | It is `TSTexture4Poly_Render`; the type registry settles it. Assigned by resemblance to VSHELL's renderer |
| A flat poly's front value is a `.DBA` frame index sampled as a dither swatch | Only `TSTexture4Poly`'s is a frame index |
| A flat/shaded surface renders as the frame's **average colour** | The value is a palette index (`TSSolidPoly`) or a ramp number (`TSShadedPoly`/`TSGouraudPoly`). Averaging `BASETEX` frames 0/8/12 gives browns and greens where ramps 0/8/12 are greys and blue-greys |
| The front value as a direct `.DPL` palette index for the lit types | Right idea, wrong table — it indexes the ramp table, not the colour table |
| `abs()` on the light term (to keep winding-flipped triangles from going black) | Gives a surface pointing away from the sun the same light as one facing it. The original flips the normal toward the **eye**, then lights it signed |
| The terrain shade curve (`512 * facing`) applied to shapes | Shapes use `Light_ComputeShadeForFace`; see the table above |
| The fixed `.RMP` row applied to `TSGouraudPoly` | That path never calls `Raster_ShadeRampRow` |
| A brightness multiplier over an expanded RGB texel, in place of the indexed lookup | See [`terrain-lighting.md`](terrain-lighting.md#rejected-readings), which carries this row |
| Interpolating the normal and computing the shade per fragment (Phong) | The original interpolates the shade computed per vertex; the two differ wherever the 0 clamp bites |
| Normals are not reachable, so Gouraud cannot be implemented | Normals are extra entries in the point list; a Gouraud poly's normal list indexes them per vertex |
| A textured quad can be fanned into two triangles carrying plain UVs | Each triangle then maps affinely and independently; they agree only on a parallelogram, and every other quad kinks along the diagonal. See "Quad mapping on triangle hardware" |
| A winding-derived face normal stands in for the stored one, the eye-facing flip cancelling the sign | It cancels only while the corner normals are that same vector. Once they come from the point list the sign is derived from one convention and applied to the other, and every Gouraud poly lights inside out — dark toward the sun. The two conventions are exactly opposed; see "Normals live in the point list" |

## Type-15 band widths

Retail's scanline across the type-15 octagon (`Reference/Gouraud_shading_comparison_2.png`, and the same structure in `Reference/Scramble_Training_Base_4.png`) is six narrow bands of ~4 px (ramp-8 entries 9 down to 4) followed by four wide ones of 28, 29, 29 and 59 px (entries 3 down to 0). The wide bands are not reproducible under the mechanism above: for the facet whose normal faces away from the sun, `128 + 256 * facing` is negative at both corners, so it must be a single flat entry-0 band, yet retail grades it.

Checked and excluded as the cause:

- The sun direction, re-derived from `BuildEulerRotationMatrixQ14`'s own arithmetic ([`terrain-lighting.md`](terrain-lighting.md#the-sun)) and independently corroborated by flat terrain being pinned at full brightness.
- Intensity, which scales both terms and cannot move the zero crossing.
- The ramp entry sequence, which matches retail exactly and in order.

A 2D scanline simulation over shape 11's real plan octagon, sweeping camera azimuth, sun azimuth and sun elevation, reproduces the band *structure* only near a sun horizontal component of ~0.50 against the derived 0.839. That simulation approximates the projection and knows neither screenshot's camera, so it bounds the problem rather than locating it.
