# WEAPONS.DAT (SHELL0/GAM) and its companion WEAPONS.BIN

Reverse-engineered from `VSHELL.EXE` disassembly and verified against real retail files. This is
the SHELL0/GAM weapon **catalog** (33 entries: id 0 = NONE + 32 real weapons) — distinct from the
simulator's `simvol0/dat/WEAPONS.DAT` (see [`weapons-dat-sim.md`](weapons-dat-sim.md)). Both share
the same 0-32 weapon id.

> **The simulator does not read this file.** DBSIM carries its own 33-entry name table and its names
> differ (`EMPC`/`SHLD` here, `EMP`/`SHIELD` there), so a cockpit fed from this catalog prints the
> wrong words. Both spellings, and the full names, are in the table below.

## The weapon id space — three spellings per weapon

One 0-32 id addresses the same weapon in this catalog, in `simvol0/dat/WEAPONS.DAT` and in
`player.mec`, but **three different name strings describe it** and no two agree throughout:

- the **catalog code** — a 4-6 character string stored in this file, one per record, and what the
  `player.mec` editor shows;
- the **simulator code** — DBSIM's own 33-entry string array at `00498eb0`, what a cockpit weapon
  gauge prints. See [`../simulation/weapon-mounts.md`](../simulation/weapon-mounts.md#names--fun_0040e18c)
  for why the simulator ignores the catalog's spelling and when a gauge prints neither;
- the **full name** — `WEAPONS.BIN`, the only player-facing prose form.

| id | Catalog | Simulator | Full name (`WEAPONS.BIN`) | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `NONE` | *(empty)* | None | empty hardpoint |
| 1 | `ATC20` | `ATC20` | Autocannon 20mm | |
| 2 | `ATC35` | `ATC35` | Autocannon 35mm | |
| 3 | `ATC50` | `ATC50` | Autocannon 50mm | |
| 4 | `ATC75` | `ATC75` | Autocannon 75mm | |
| 5 | `ATC100` | `ATC100` | Autocannon 100mm | |
| 6 | `ELFW` | `ELF` | Electron Flux | |
| 7 | `EMPC` | `EMP` | Elec.Mag. Pulse | |
| 8 | `L100` | `LAS100` | Laser 100 GW | |
| 9 | `L200` | `LAS200` | Laser 200 GW | |
| 10 | `L300` | `LAS300` | Laser 300 GW | |
| 11 | `L400` | `LAS400` | Laser 400 GW | |
| 12 | `L500` | `LAS500` | Laser 500 GW | |
| 13 | `MSL6` | `6` | Missile Rack 6X | gauge prints the loaded round, not this |
| 14 | `MSL8` | `8` | Missile Rack 8X | gauge prints the loaded round, not this |
| 15 | `MSL10` | `10` | Missile Rack 10X | gauge prints the loaded round, not this |
| 16 | `FLYMSL` | `24` | Razor Missile Rack | gauge prints the loaded round, not this |
| 17 | `PBW` | `PBEAM` | Particle Beam | |
| 18 | `ECM` | `ECM` | Radar Jammer | no projectile |
| 19 | `BEMP` | `EMP` | Bull Elec. Mag. Pulse | Bull only |
| 20 | `BPBW` | `PBEAM` | Bull Particle Beam | Bull only |
| 21 | `BMSL` | `MISSL` | Bull Missile Rack | Bull only |
| 22 | `ELF2` | `ELF2` | Electron Flux II | |
| 23 | `EMP2` | `EMP2` | Elec.Mag. Pulse II | |
| 24 | `PBW2` | `PBW2` | Particle Beam II | |
| 25 | `PLAS` | `PLAS` | Plasma Cannon | |
| 26 | `LAEW` | `LAEW` | Locust Launcher | cut — see [`../cut-content.md`](../cut-content.md) |
| 27 | `MINE` | `MINE` | Mine Launcher. | cut — see [`../cut-content.md`](../cut-content.md) |
| 28 | `MFAC` | `MAGN` | MagnetoFusion Cannon. | |
| 29 | `TARG` | `TARG` | Targeting Pod. | pod, no projectile |
| 30 | `SHLD` | `SHIELD` | Shield Pod. | pod, no projectile |
| 31 | `TURB` | `TURBO` | Turbo Pod. | pod, no projectile |
| 32 | `ENRG` | `ENERGY` | Energy Pod. | pod, no projectile |

Full names are quoted verbatim: ids 27-32 really do carry a trailing full stop in `WEAPONS.BIN`,
and the lasers really are `GW` there where the codes say plain `L100`.

The three **Bull** weapons are the Cybrid four-legged HERC's own armament and can never be equipped
to a player HERC in retail. They are oversized versions of the player equivalents — `BEMP` is the
only weapon in the game with a barrel count of 3, and `BMSL` carries 36 rounds — so reading a
`BEMP` figure as an EMP-family stat overstates the family by 4x on shields. Their sim-side templates
are also the only ones carrying `Field0 = 15000` where every other weapon carries 1500-2500.

### The rank byte, and what retail actually fits

Each record's trailing `int16` — the one that lands in `DAT_00483fa2[id]` rather than in the record
— sorts the catalog, and it separates the three groups cleanly. Twenty-eight weapons hold **ranks
1-28**, a permutation with no gap or repeat — `PLAS` is 1 and `MSL6` is 28, so a low rank is an
advanced weapon. `NONE` and the three Bull weapons hold **99**. `MFAC` alone holds **0**, outside
the sequence in both directions.

Parsing the mech roster (row #12's ten-slot fit at `0x32`) of all 62 retail `.MSN` files — 1683
records — gives the complementary view. Eight ids are fitted by nothing:

| Never fitted | Rank | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| `ATC75` (4), `L400` (11), `FLYMSL` (16), `ECM` (18) | 12, 13, 24, 25 | ordinary player weapons; the roster is the **AI** side only, and the player's own fit comes from `player.mec` |
| `BPBW` (20) | 99 | Bull armament that no retail mission ever spawns, unlike `BEMP` (12 missions) and `BMSL` (2) |
| `LAEW` (26), `MINE` (27) | 8, 15 | inert templates — nothing could fire them anyway |
| `MFAC` (28) | 0 | a complete, working weapon that nothing in retail fits |

**The roster scan cannot settle player availability by itself** — `ATC75` and `L400` are plainly
buildable and appear in it exactly as rarely as `MFAC` does. What settles it is
`gam\arm_weap.dat`, the armory screen's panel layout: it lists **26 weapons**, and the seven ids
with no panel are `NONE`, the three Bull weapons, `LAEW`, `MINE` and `MFAC`. A weapon with no panel
cannot be queued, so those seven are unbuyable however the rank byte reads. `ATC75` and `L400` both
have panels.

That also puts rank 0 in its place: `MFAC` is unbuyable because it has no panel, not because of its
rank, and the rank's only established job is ordering. See
[`herc-catalogs.md`](herc-catalogs.md#gamarm_weapdat), and
[`../shell/armory.md`](../shell/armory.md#what-the-armory-will-sell) for the purchase path.

`LAEW`, `MINE` and `MFAC` are indexed in [`../cut-content.md`](../cut-content.md).

## WEAPONS.BIN — weapon name strings (fully confirmed, byte-exact)

Lives in `ES2/VOL/LANG0.VOL` (one copy per language folder: `ENG`, `FRE`, `GER`) — **not** in
`SHELL0.VOL` alongside `WEAPONS.DAT` itself, which is why it's easy to miss when only looking at
the loose-extracted `SHELL0/GAM/` tree. Extract via `HercWorks.Vol.Io.VolFileReader.ParseVolFile`.

Verified byte-exact against all 3 language copies (identical; weapon names not localized):

```
0x00  uint32 count          -- 33, matches the WEAPONS.DAT catalog's real entry count exactly
0x04  uint32 stringDataSize -- size in bytes of the string-pool region below (505 for the real file:
                               579 total - 4 - 4 - 33*2 = 505, confirms this field's meaning exactly)
0x08  uint16[count] offsets -- relative offsets (from the start of the string pool, i.e. from
                               byte 0x08 + count*2) to each entry's null-terminated name string
...   string pool           -- packed null-terminated ASCII strings, one per weapon, in catalog
                               id order (offsets[0] = "None", offsets[1] = "Autocannon 20mm", etc.)
```

Read by VSHELL: `WeaponsBin_LookupName` (`00408240`) indexes it as `offsets[id] + stringPoolStart`,
and `WeaponsBin_Open` (`00408605`) opens it by literal filename.

### The `.BIN` string tables

**The container is not weapon-specific.** That same open/lookup pair loads every `.BIN` file in
`LANG0.VOL`; the names those two functions carry in this project's symbol set record the first file
identified, not the format's scope.

| File | Handle | Entries | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `weapons.bin` | `maybe_WeaponsBinFileHandle` | 33 | the weapon names above, by catalog id |
| `estext.bin` | `0046dcc0` | 342 | the shell's UI text — `[2]` `MAIN MENU`, `[0x21]` `EMPTY`, `[0x3d]` `REPAIR` |
| `esnames.bin` | local to `FUN_0040fa31` | 36 | the pilot-name pool: `DUGGAN`, `BRUTUS`, `BUTCHER`, `RIGGS` … `HOYLE` |
| `missions.bin` | `0046fb34` | 61 | mission paths, `MSN\TRAIN1.MSN` … `MSN\C5_10.MSN`, indexed by `gam\career.dat` |
| `wpn_info.bin` | — | 130 | the armory's stat panel, **5 strings per armory slot** |
| `wpn_desc.bin` | — | 130 | the armory's prose panel, same indexing |

All six walk byte-exact against the retail files: `8 + count*2 + poolSize` equals the file length in
every case.

`wpn_info.bin` and `wpn_desc.bin` are indexed by **`gam\arm_weap.dat`'s panel order, not by catalog
id** — 26 slots of five strings each. Slot 0's five are `Type: Autocannon 20 mm`, `Range: 450 m
Salvage Required: 5,000 kg`, an empty line, and two description lines. Their `Salvage Required`
figures agree with this file's `0x14` price times 1000 for all 26 slots, which is what confirms both
the indexing and the unit. See [`herc-catalogs.md`](herc-catalogs.md#gamarm_weapdat).

**`LANG0.VOL` is not localized.** Every entry — all six `.BIN` files and `CAMPAIGN.STR` — is
byte-identical across the `ENG\`, `FRE\` and `GER\` directories, so the three language trees in the
retail build are three copies of the English text.

All 33 names are in the id-space table above, transcribed from `WEAPONS_ENG.BIN`.

## WEAPONS.DAT catalog record (29 bytes)

Loaded by `VSHELL.EXE`'s `LoadWeaponsDat` (`00411fc4`, file-level) → `WeaponsDat_ReadRecord`
(`00411d57`, per-record). Stored in-memory as a flat array at `DAT_00483be4`, 29-byte (`0x1d`)
stride per weapon id (confirmed via `IMUL EDX,EDX,0x1d` in `FUN_0041266a`).

```
0x00–0x0f  (16 bytes) the catalog code, NUL-terminated ASCII. The file supplies strlen+1 bytes of
           it behind an int16 length, so the stored block is short and the rest of the buffer is
           whatever the zero-initialized array held
0x10–0x13  pointer to this weapon's WEAPONS.BIN full name, filled at load from
           WeaponsBin_LookupName(handle, id) — runtime only
0x14–0x15  uint16 price in tons, scaled ×1000 at load to give the cost in kg. Used in
           cost calculations (`FUN_00412428`, `FUN_0041266a`) as (price/1000) × field_0x17 / 10
0x16       byte — the player's unlock flag for this weapon (see below)
0x17–0x18  short — how many units of this weapon the player owns. Not a catalog value: it counts
           the runtime list at 0x19, and FUN_0041266a multiplies it by the price to value the stock
0x19–0x1c  head of that owned-unit list ({ entry*, next* } nodes, 10-byte entries), runtime only —
           which is why the file never supplies it
```

**The whole record is accounted for**, and none of it holds a numeric weapon stat: 16 bytes of code,
a name pointer, a price, a flag, an owned count and a list head is 29 exactly. Damage, heat, rate of
fire and range live on the simulator side ([`weapons-dat-sim.md`](weapons-dat-sim.md)); the only
range figure the shell has is the prose in `wpn_info.bin`.

`0x16`, `0x17` and the `0x19` list are the armory's per-weapon inventory, and the save file is where
they persist: [`save-games.md`](save-games.md) documents the block that writes all 33 of them, and
the armory itself is `armory.cpp` (`FUN_00411efd` appends a purchased unit to the list).

### `0x16` is the weapon-unlock flag

The catalog ships a starting value per weapon; from then on it is campaign state, and four VSHELL
sites establish what it means:

- **Campaign progress sets it.** In the mission-load path, for each pending unlock whose slot in the
  campaign flag array holds the expected value, a `0` byte is set to `1` and that flag slot is
  cleared — an unlock granted and consumed. This is the weapon-unlock mechanism the campaign
  condition system feeds; see [`../shell/campaign-loop.md`](../shell/campaign-loop.md).
- **The armory screen gates display on it.** Where it is `0` the weapon's panel is disabled — enable
  field at panel `+0x49` cleared, its four buttons greyed, its price never drawn. Where it is `1`
  the panel is live and prints the `0x14` price.
- **Purchasing skips a locked weapon**, whatever the player can afford.
- One HERC-fit check refuses to accept the weapon while the flag is clear.

All 33 flags are also exported to `data\player.mec`, which nothing traced reads back — see
[`../shell/campaign-loop.md`](../shell/campaign-loop.md).

## File-level format

Verified byte-exact: the walk below consumes all 707 bytes of the retail file.

```
int16   record count -- 33
per record:
  int16       weapon id
  int16       blockLen
  blockLen B  the catalog code, NUL included -- read into 0x00 of the record above
  int16       price in tons
  byte        unlock flag
  int16       the rank byte (see below)
int16   starting stock count -- 39
        that many 6-byte weapon unit records: { int16 id; int16 condition; int16 ammo type }
```

Because the code is length-prefixed and the trailer is fixed, walking name-then-trailer from the
first record recovers all 33 codes in id order. That walk produced the id-space table above; the
codes never need hand-transcribing.

The rank goes into a *separate* parallel array (`DAT_00483fa2[id]`), not into the 29-byte struct.

The trailing block is the **armory's starting stock**: `LoadWeaponsDat` allocates one ten-byte
weapon unit per entry, reads three of its fields, and appends it to that catalog record's `0x19`
list through `FUN_00411efd` — so the player opens a career owning these 39 units. Retail's are four
`ATC50`, three `ECM` and two each of sixteen other ids, all at condition 100. The unit record is
shared with the HERC mounts and the save's armory stock; see
[`herc-catalogs.md`](herc-catalogs.md#the-weapon-unit-record).

## Rejected readings

| Reading | Why it is wrong |
|---|---|
| `0x00–0x13` is a stat block holding damage, range or rate of fire | It is a 16-byte buffer for the catalog code plus a 4-byte runtime name pointer. `WeaponsDat_ReadRecord` reads `blockLen` bytes into `0x00` where `blockLen` is `strlen(code)+1`, and `LoadWeaponsDat` writes `0x10` from `WeaponsBin_LookupName`. The record carries no numeric stat but the price |
| `0x17` is an ammo or round count | It is the number of units the player owns. The save writes it as the length of the `0x19` linked list and then serializes exactly that many 10-byte units (`FUN_00411e64`), and the reader allocates that many nodes back. Round counts do exist — `BMSL` carries 36 — but they live on the simulator side |
| `0x19–0x1c` is unread file data | It is a runtime list head. `WeaponsDat_ReadRecord` fills only `0x00`–`0x16` from the file — 23 of the 29 bytes; the last six are filled by the armory and the save loader |
| The file ends after the 33rd record | 236 bytes of starting stock follow it, and a reader that stops early silently drops the player's opening inventory |

## How to apply

Both files are fully decoded and safe to write transformers for directly. `WEAPONS.BIN` is the
smaller win — 579 bytes, a trivial indexed string table, and the same shape for all six `.BIN`
files, so one reader serves them all.

`WEAPONS.DAT` needs a transformer that keeps two things straight. The 29-byte in-memory record is
**not** the on-disk record: only `0x00`–`0x16` come from the file, the code block is
length-prefixed and variable, and the rank lives in a parallel array rather than in the struct. And
the file does not end with the catalog — a round-trip that drops the 39-unit starting stock loses
the player's opening inventory silently, since nothing about the file's length gives it away.
