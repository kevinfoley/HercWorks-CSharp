# Command line: Herculan.Engine.Host

Every argument `Herculan.Engine.Host` accepts. The parser is `HostOptions.Parse` in `src/Herculan.Engine.Host/HostOptions.cs`; this page lists what each flag does and links the doc that explains the feature behind it. The retail executables' switches are in [`launch-options.md`](../retail/launch-options.md) and [`command-line.md`](../retail/command-line.md).

Flags are this engine's own. Where one stands in for a retail switch, the table says which. Flags are case-sensitive, take `--` only, and can come in any order. `--help` (or `-h`, `-?`) prints a summary and exits. An unknown flag, a missing or out-of-range value, or a third positional argument stops the host with a message naming each problem, before it looks for the install.

```
Herculan.Engine.Host [<install>] [<mission>] [flags]
```

## Positional arguments

| Position | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1 | The Earthsiege 2 install: the folder holding the archive directory. Without it the host reads the `ES2_GAME_PATH` environment variable, then tries the install it last used, then looks for an `ES2` folder beside the executable or any folder above it, and when all of those fail opens a window asking for the folder, with the system's folder picker where there is one. A named install that is not one stops the host with a message, as does a failed search under `--screenshot`. Whichever install runs is remembered in `install-path.txt` beside `tweak-settings.json`, except under `--ask-install`. |
| 2 | The mission to fly: a `script.dat` ([`../retail/formats/script-dat.md`](../retail/formats/script-dat.md)) with the `mission.var` and `player.mec` the original reads beside it (either missing shows an error box and quits, as the original does), or a mission named by its `.MSN` — `C1_03`, `C1_03.MSN` or `MSN\C1_03.MSN` — from those `gam\career.dat` lists. Naming one implies `--mission`. Under `--mission` without one, `DATA\script.dat` in the install. `--play` and `--demo` replace it with the mission their tape carries. |

A named mission is loaded as the shell loads that career position ([`../retail/shell/campaign-loop.md`](../retail/shell/campaign-loop.md#loading-the-careers-mission)) and flown from a handoff written into the install's `DATA`, as a launch from the front end is. A practice or demo mission takes the training load, with the practice options `DATA\prefs.cfg` holds, as `Begin Mission` or `INSTANT ACTION` on its row would. A campaign mission is loaded for a career with no history: every campaign flag 0 until the load seeds its own, and the player's lance and skill from `DATA\player.mec`, which it needs.

## What runs

Without one of these, the host runs the front end and the missions it launches, coming back to it after each as `ES.EXE` does ([`command-line.md`](../retail/command-line.md#the-loop)). See [`../retail/shell/screen-layout.md`](../retail/shell/screen-layout.md).

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--mission` | Flies one mission without the front end, and exits when it ends. A named mission, `--play` and `--demo` imply it. |
| `--movie <name>` | Plays one cutscene: a path, or a name looked up in the install's `AVI` folder, with or without the extension. See [`video-playback.md`](video-playback.md#looking-at-one). |
| `--play <tape>` | Replays an input tape: a path, or a stem looked up in the install's `TAPES` folder. Hands the controls to the player when the tape runs out. Implies `--mission`. Retail's `-p<name>`. See [`input-tapes.md`](input-tapes.md). |
| `--record <tape>` | Records the mission's input to `<tape>.tap`, which `--play` replays. Cannot be combined with `--play` or `--demo`. Retail's `-r<name>`. See [`input-tapes.md`](input-tapes.md#recording). |
| `--demo` | Plays a tape picked from `TAPES\demolist.str`, as VIEW DEMO does, and ends the mission when the tape runs out or a key is pressed. With `--play`, plays that tape in demo mode instead. Implies `--mission`. Retail's `-D`. |

## Front end

These stage the front end's first turn only, and none of them combines with `--mission`.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--shell-tab <0-7>` | The tab the front end opens on, in place of the main menu and the startup sequence before it. |
| `--shell-bay <0-7>` | The hangar bay the repair tab works on. |
| `--shell-training` | Runs the front end in training mode, the practice missions' and `INSTANT ACTION`'s, which gates REPAIR, BUILD and ARMORY off, whatever mode `data\prefs.cfg` holds. |
| `--shell-practice` | Opens on the practice missions screen, as the main menu's PRACTICE MISSIONS does, without the startup sequence. |
| `--shell-windowed` | Keeps the front end windowed at startup, where `data\prefs.cfg` option 6 would put it in full screen. This engine's own flag; retail's `-d` has no effect ([`../retail/shell/main-menu.md`](../retail/shell/main-menu.md#full-screen-asks-first)). |
| `--shell-no-movies` | Turns the front end's movies off: nothing is queued and nothing plays, and the music stays at the startup's silence until a fade raises it. Retail's `-a` ([`../retail/shell/movies-and-sound.md`](../retail/shell/movies-and-sound.md#the-shells-movies)). |
| `--shell-palette <name>` | Pins `dpl\<name>.DPL` as the palette for the whole run, in place of each tab's own. |

See [`../retail/shell/screen-layout.md`](../retail/shell/screen-layout.md).

## Sound and music

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--no-sound`, `--silent` | Opens no audio device. Everything that drives sound still runs; nothing is heard. Retail's `-s`. In the shell, as with `-s`, there is no sound manager at all, so the music track is not flipped. |
| `--music <n>` | The CD track select: the mission plays track *n* % 5 + 2. Retail's `-R<n>`. From the front end each mission launched counts on from it, as the launcher counts from 0; a `--mission` run without it plays track 2. |
| `--cd-drive <drive>` | The drive holding the music CD. |
| `--music-dir <dir>` | A folder of `Track02.wav` … `Track07.wav` to play in place of the disc. |

Without `--music-dir`, an install whose disc is an image with audio tracks plays them in place of a CD drive's (`ImageMusicSource`). See [`../retail/simulation/audio.md`](../retail/simulation/audio.md#cd-audio).

## Settings and input devices

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--ask-install` | Opens the window asking for the install at once, skipping `ES2_GAME_PATH`, the install last used and the `ES2` folder search, and leaves `install-path.txt` as it was: neither the folder picked there nor one the Settings menu changes to is remembered. An install named as the first argument is used without asking, and still not remembered. Cannot be combined with `--screenshot` unless the install is named. |
| `--windowed` | Keeps every mission windowed at startup, where `data\prefs.cfg` option 6 would put it in full screen; `--shell-windowed` is the front end's. A mission it kept windowed that is still windowed when it ends leaves option 6 as it was, where retail writes the state back ([`../retail/simulation/preferences.md`](../retail/simulation/preferences.md#the-video-mode-and-full-screen-bytes)). A `--screenshot` mission is kept windowed the same way. This engine's own flag. |
| `--no-write-prefs` | Leaves `data\prefs.cfg` unwritten: when the preferences and controls panels close, when a mission ends in a different display mode from the one option 6 holds, and in the shell at startup, on a change of campaign or training mode, and on `Begin Mission` and `INSTANT ACTION`. See [`../retail/simulation/preferences.md`](../retail/simulation/preferences.md) and [`../retail/shell/movies-and-sound.md`](../retail/shell/movies-and-sound.md#sound). |
| `--joystick [0-8]` | Pretends a stick with throttle, rudder and hat is attached, so the CONTROLS panel's joystick rows are live without hardware. The number sets how many of the eight button rows are live; without it, all eight. A real stick, when one is attached, takes precedence. |
| `--joystick-probe` | Prints each axis and button of the attached stick as it moves. |
| `--write-joystick-map` | Writes the joystick map in force to `data\herculan-joystick.cfg`. |

See [`joystick-config.md`](joystick-config.md).

## Installing

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--install <disc> <folder>` | Installs Earthsiege 2 from a retail disc folder or disc image (`.iso`, `.bin`, `.cue`) into a new or empty folder, as the Settings menu's install window does, then exits: 0 when the install is complete, 1 when it was refused or failed, having removed what it copied. Never looks for an install or opens a window. See `RetailInstaller` and [`retail-builds.md`](../retail/retail-builds.md#the-installer). |
| `--install-size minimum\|medium\|maximum` | The size, as the retail installer offers it. Default `maximum`. |
| `--install-language english\|french\|german` | The language written to `data\language.cfg`, and for v1.10 the voice archive, error and mission strings and readme copied. Default `english`. |
| `--install-disc-files` | Also copies what both programs always read from the disc — the movies, the training instructor's clips and the on-line manual — for the language the install runs in, as the install window's box (ticked there by default) does. With `maximum`, the install then needs its disc only for the CD music. See `RetailInstaller.Plan`. |

## Developer

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--developer` | The developer keys. Retail's `-SPRUNKNOWN`. See [`herculan-key-bindings.md`](herculan-key-bindings.md#developer-keys). Also puts Debug on a mission's [Shift+Esc] menu bar, and gives the front end retail's `-@`: each career's mission load waits on [the DEBUG dialog](../retail/shell/main-menu.md#the-mission-name-dialog), where a mission file can be typed in place of the career's. |

## Screenshots and staged state

`--save-prtscn` also writes each frame [PrtScn] copies to the clipboard while a window is full screen into the install's `Screenshots` folder, as a PNG named for the moment it was taken. It works in the front end and in a mission, and has nothing to do with `--screenshot`. This engine's own flag. See [`herculan-key-bindings.md`](herculan-key-bindings.md).

`--screenshot <file>` renders 30 frames, captures the window to `<file>` and exits. It works for the front end, `--mission` and `--movie`, and hides the menu bar. A front-end capture opens on the main menu without its startup sequence. A screenshot run sees no keyboard or mouse input, so the flags below put the cockpit into the state to be photographed at power-up; they work in an interactive run too. A cockpit capture needs `--mission`: without it the front end is what is photographed.

Several of them hold the capture past the 30 frames until what they stage is on screen:

| Flag | Holds the capture until |
|---|---|
| `--target` | a target is acquired |
| `--fire` | a round, beam or rocket is in flight |
| `--impact` | an impact effect carries a light |
| `--hit-shake` | the hit's palette flash is up |
| `--wait-transmission` | a squadmate's portrait is up |

### Cockpit and views

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--mfd <0-5>` | The MFD screen at power-up, in `[F1]`–`[F6]` order. See [`../retail/simulation/mfd.md`](../retail/simulation/mfd.md). |
| `--hdd [0\|1]` | Starts panned down to the Heads-Down Display: 0 the command display (`[F7]`, the default), 1 the damage detail (`[F8]`). See [`../retail/simulation/heads-down-display.md`](../retail/simulation/heads-down-display.md). |
| `--hdd-damage <0-2>` | The damage screen's category: 0 structural (`[S]`), 1 internal (`[I]`), 2 weapons (`[W]`). |
| `--hdd-subject <0-4>` | The damage screen's subject, as the left and right arrows step it: 0 the player, 1-3 a squad slot, 4 the target. An empty squad slot starts on the player. |
| `--external` | Starts in the outside view, as if `[V]` were pressed at launch. See [`key-bindings.md`](../retail/key-bindings.md#displays-and-views). |
| `--objectives` | Opens the `[F11]` objectives panel. See [`../retail/simulation/alert-panels.md`](../retail/simulation/alert-panels.md#the-objectives-panel--obj_alrt-0045751c). |
| `--quit [0-19]` | Raises the `[Q]` mission-status alert. Without a number it shows the status the mission evaluates to; a number forces that `GNL_ALRT.STR` row, 0 and 1 being the pause panel's. |
| `--preferences` | Opens the `[F12]` preferences panel. See [`../retail/simulation/preferences.md`](../retail/simulation/preferences.md). |
| `--controls` | Opens the preferences panel with the CONTROLS panel over it. |
| `--hit-shake` | Lands one hit on the cockpit, for the damage shake and its palette flash. See [`../retail/rendering/cockpit-canopy-palette.md`](../retail/rendering/cockpit-canopy-palette.md#the-damage-shake). |

### Movement and weapons

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--throttle <n>` | Starts with the throttle at *n*, clamped to ±1024 (full travel). See [`../retail/simulation/cockpit-hud-widgets.md`](../retail/simulation/cockpit-hud-widgets.md#throttle-gauge). |
| `--heading <n>` | Turns the lower body to binary angle *n* (`0x4000` is a quarter turn) in place of the heading along the first leg of its route. |
| `--turret <twist> <pitch>` | Holds both turret axes for the whole run, each clamped to ±256. See [`../retail/simulation/torso-aim.md`](../retail/simulation/torso-aim.md). |
| `--track` | Starts with Automatic Turret Tracking latched. It has nothing to hold without `--target`. |
| `--target` | Switches the scanner on and selects the nearest target after five ticks. See [`../retail/simulation/target-selection.md`](../retail/simulation/target-selection.md). |
| `--weapon <1-10>` | Arms that weapon panel row, numbered as the row prints it. See [`../retail/simulation/cockpit-hud-widgets.md`](../retail/simulation/cockpit-hud-widgets.md#weapon-hardpoint-rows). |
| `--link` | Links the row `--weapon` arms. |
| `--fire` | Holds the trigger down for the whole run. |
| `--impact` | Holds a `--screenshot` capture until an impact effect carries a light. Useful only with `--fire`. See [`../retail/rendering/effect-lights.md`](../retail/rendering/effect-lights.md). |

### Squad orders

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--hdd-pilot <0-2>` | The command display's selected comm box. The order list is greyed out until a pilot is selected. |
| `--hdd-order <0-7>` | The armed order, 0 Disengage, 1 Attack Enemy, 2 Defend Position, 3 Patrol Gridpoint, 4 Goto Gridpoint, 5 Join On Me, 6 Scan For Hostiles, 7 EMCON. |
| `--hdd-xmit` | Presses XMIT on the armed order, taking the map centre where the order needs a pick, and prints the squad's standing orders before and after the run. |
| `--flash-comm <0-5>` | The FLASH COMM row the cursor starts on. See [`../retail/simulation/mfd.md`](../retail/simulation/mfd.md). |
| `--flash-comm-xmit` | Presses XMIT on that row once the mission is up. |
| `--wait-transmission` | Holds a `--screenshot` capture until a squadmate's portrait is up. Useful only with `--flash-comm-xmit`. |

The squadmate side of both is in [`../retail/simulation/ai-squadmates.md`](../retail/simulation/ai-squadmates.md) and [`../retail/simulation/heads-down-display.md`](../retail/simulation/heads-down-display.md).
