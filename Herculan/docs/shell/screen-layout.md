# Shell screen layout

How VSHELL puts a screen together: the canvas it authors in, where the layout numbers live, the widget tree behind every tab screen, and the shared resources the whole front end draws with. The economy behind the screens is in [`armory.md`](armory.md); the campaign state they read and write is in [`campaign-loop.md`](campaign-loop.md).

## The canvas is 640x480, and rects are inclusive

Every tab screen parents its widgets to a panel built with the rect `{0, 0, 0x27f, 0x1df}` — 0..639 by 0..479. Both corners are inclusive, which is why the far corner is one less than the dimension, and it is the convention every widget rect in the executable follows.

The shell has no second video mode. DBSIM ships each panel resource twice, `dba\`/`hba\` and `dfn\`/`hfn\`, and picks between them off a video-mode global; `SHELL0.VOL` ships one set of each, and its screens are authored at the size that set is drawn at.

## The layouts are executable literals, not data

`ServiceBay_BuildScreen` (`0043a944`, `wsrvbayi.cpp`) writes every widget rect as four immediates onto its own stack and hands the block to a widget constructor. The function opens no file: there is no `fopen`, no volume read and no ClassIO stream call anywhere in it. The same shape repeats across the other tab screens' builders.

The `gam\arm_*.dat`, `gam\rpr_*.dat` and `gam\arm_weap.dat` records are the exception, and they are narrower than they look: each positions one *content* panel against a frame of the matching `dba\` sheet ([`../formats/herc-catalogs.md`](../formats/herc-catalogs.md#the-screen-layout-families)). Nothing in them describes the frame those panels sit in.

## The widget tree of a tab screen

Three levels, built in this order:

1. **The root**, textured with the backdrop bitmap the shell's global init keeps in `DAT_0046dcd4`, sized to its parent's rect rather than to a literal.
2. **A full-screen panel** at `{0, 0, 0x27f, 0x1df}`, which every other widget on the screen is parented to. Because it sits at the origin, a child's rect is also its canvas rect — parent-relative and absolute coincide for everything on the strip.
3. **The strip itself**: one square button and eight tabs.

Widget fields the builders and the tab handlers write directly:

`Control_Ctor` (`00409788`) is the base every one of them goes through. It zeroes `+0x45`, sets `+0x49` to 1 and ORs `0x60` into the flags word at `+0x39`.

| Offset | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `+0x45` | the lit flag. The widget's own mouse handler toggles it 0/1, and the paint picks the button's face from it. A tab handler writes 1 and repaints before building its screen, which is what latches the active tab lit; one block clears it across all eight and sets tab 7's |
| `+0x49` | 1 from the constructor. The button's paint reads it for one thing — whether the caption takes the pressed nudge. The builder clears it on tab 5 and the strip refresh (`0043b0c8`) rewrites it on tabs 2-6 from campaign state in `DAT_0048260c`; whatever stops a cleared tab responding is elsewhere and is not read, and neither is that state |
| `+0x51` | written 0 on both the root and the full-screen panel. Not the button field of the same offset — different class, different layout past the base |

## The tab strip

All nine buttons share the top and bottom edges `4` and `0x1b`. The tabs are 75 pixels wide on a 76-pixel pitch — butted one pixel apart.

| Widget | Rect | Caption | Art |
|---|---|---|---|
| square button | `{7, 4, 0x17, 0x1b}` | none | `dba\online.dba` frames 0 and 1 |
| tab 0 | `{0x19, 4, 0x63, 0x1b}` | `0x13` `MAIN MENU` | `dba\mnu_bttn.dba` frames 1 and 2 |
| tab 1 | `{0x65, 4, 0xaf, 0x1b}` | `0x14` `SAVE` | as tab 0 |
| tab 2 | `{0xb1, 4, 0xfb, 0x1b}` | `0x15` `WEAPONS` | as tab 0 |
| tab 3 | `{0xfd, 4, 0x147, 0x1b}` | `0x16` `REPAIR` | as tab 0 |
| tab 4 | `{0x149, 4, 0x193, 0x1b}` | `0x17` `BUILD` | as tab 0 |
| tab 5 | `{0x195, 4, 0x1df, 0x1b}` | `0x18` `ARMORY` | as tab 0 |
| tab 6 | `{0x1e1, 4, 0x22b, 0x1b}` | `0x19` `CREW` | as tab 0 |
| tab 7 | `{0x22d, 4, 0x277, 0x1b}` | `0x1a` `MISSION` | as tab 0 |

Those captions corroborate three of the assert-string module identifications independently: tab 2 `WEAPONS` is the screen `warmingi.cpp` builds, tab 5 `ARMORY` is `warmoryi.cpp`'s and tab 6 `CREW` is `wcrewi.cpp`'s, each reached through that tab's own handler.

`ButtonIcon_Ctor` (`00409d14`) stores three frame pointers, at `+0x51`, `+0x55` and `+0x59`, and **a button has only two faces**: both of the class's paints — `0040a05d` and the subclass's `0040a26d` — pick between the first two and never read the third. Every button on the strip passes `mnu_bttn` frame 3 as that unread third, including the square one whose two faces come from a different bank.

The caption is an embedded `Text` child at `+0x4d`, sized to the button's full client rect, drawn in the font at `DAT_0046dccc` and fetched with `WeaponsBin_LookupName(DAT_0046dcc0, index)` from `estext.bin`. The paint places it one pixel above its vertically-centred row when the button is idle and one below when it is lit, so a lit caption sits two pixels lower than an idle one — the pressed nudge. The centring itself is a baseline: `(FUN_00453fa8(text +0xb1) + rectHeight + 1) / 2`, whose argument and callee are not identified.

The strip is rebuilt by each tab screen's own builder at these same coordinates rather than shared between them. `DAT_0047581c` holds which tab is up, 0-7, and each handler checks it before doing anything: clicking the tab you are already on is a no-op.

## What the whole front end shares

`esglobal.cpp`'s init (`004073bc`, called with 1 on entering the shell) loads what every screen then draws with:

| Resource | Handle | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `dfn\font2.dfn` | `0046dcc4` | loaded twice, into this handle and the next |
| `dfn\font2.dfn` | `0046dcc8` | |
| `dfn\black.dfn` | `0046dccc` | every tab caption |
| `dbm\bay2a_84.dbm` | `0046dcd4` | the backdrop each screen's root is textured with |
| `bin\estext.bin` | `0046dcc0` | all UI text — 342 entries, see [`../formats/weapons-dat.md`](../formats/weapons-dat.md#the-bin-string-tables) |

`dfn\font.dfn` is in the archive and the init does not ask for it.

## The palette

`FUN_004075b2(index)` installs one, from a pointer table of palette names at `0046dcdc` whose first entry is `dpl\intr_pt1.dpl`. The table's contents past entry 0 are not decoded.

Index 1 is what the shell installs on entry and what the service bay re-installs whenever it is shown (`0043b23d`), so it is the palette the tab screens are drawn through. `SHELL0.VOL` carries a `dpl\bay.dpl` alongside `palette.dpl`, `arming.dpl`, `esii.dpl` and the per-theater sets, and the bay screen's own name makes it the candidate — but nothing has been read that ties a name to an index.

## Engine coverage

`Herculan.Engine.Shell` draws the shell frame: the tiled backdrop, the square button and the eight captioned tabs, hit-tested and latching. The canvas is placed by `ShellScreenLayout`, which scales the fixed 640x480 by window height and centres it, so every rect above is used exactly as the original states it.

Not drawn: any tab's content, the mouse cursor (`dba\cursor.dba`), the `+0x49` gate, and the sounds each button plays. See [`../../ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md).

## Rejected readings

| Reading | Why it is wrong |
|---|---|
| A button's three frame pointers are unlit, lit and disabled | `ButtonIcon_Ctor` really does take and store three, and a third face for a widget the strip refresh can gate is the natural guess. Neither paint reads `+0x59`: both branch on the lit flag between `+0x51` and `+0x55` only. A gated tab in retail looks exactly like an idle one |
| `SHELL0.VOL`'s `dba\` and `dfn\` are the 320-wide halves of a pair, as they are in the simulator archives, and shell art must be doubled to reach the canvas | There is no `hba\` or `hfn\` in `SHELL0.VOL`. The shell has one set and authors its screens at the size that set draws at — the `{0, 0, 0x27f, 0x1df}` panel is 640x480 and the button plates fill their 75x24 rects at 1:1 |
| A screen's widget rects come from its `gam\rpr_*.dat` or `gam\arm_*.dat` file, the way a cockpit widget's come from the herc's `.GAU` | Those files exist and do carry widget geometry, which makes the inference natural. They cover the per-chassis content panels only; the screen builders that place everything else read no file at all |
| `warmingi.cpp` is a warning dialog | It is `w` + `arming` + `i`, the weapon-fitting screen, in the same naming pattern as `wsrvbayi.cpp`, `wcrewi.cpp` and `warmoryi.cpp` |
