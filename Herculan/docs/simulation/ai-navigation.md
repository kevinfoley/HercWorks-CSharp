# AI navigation — routes, formation, and obstacle avoidance

How an AI machine gets from where it is to where its order wants it. The order layer that says *where* is [`ai-goals.md`](ai-goals.md); the state a machine is in while it walks is [`ai-dispatch.md`](ai-dispatch.md); the control law the whole of this doc ends in is `Mech_LocomotionTick` in [`mech-locomotion.md`](mech-locomotion.md).

**Movement is the think slot's job, not the move slot's.** Eighteen of the 22 states share `Mech_MovementTick` as their move, and that function only integrates the animation and resolves collisions — it makes no decisions. Every steering decision in the game is a think function calling `Mech_LocomotionTick` directly with a turn axis and a desired speed.

## The four movement primitives

| Address | Name | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `0041fac4` | `Ai_DriveToPoint` | Walk at a fixed point. Returns "arrived" |
| `0041fb60` | `Ai_FollowRoute` | Walk the group's route, one waypoint at a time, advancing the cursor |
| `0041fbb8` | `Ai_KeepFormation` | Hold a formation slot on the group leader |
| `0041d598` | `Ai_NavigationStep` | Picks between the three, then updates the turret and the radar mode |

`Ai_NavigationStep` is the whole choice:

```
if (mech+0x23e != 0)                  Ai_DriveToPoint(mech, mech+0x240)   // a standing squad order
else if (mech == group.members[0])    Ai_FollowRoute(mech)                // the leader
else                                  Ai_KeepFormation(mech)              // everyone else
Ai_UpdateWeaponsFree(mech)                                                // 0041c3c8, the radar mode
Mech_CenterTorsoTick(mech, 0)
```

**Only the leader follows the route.** Everyone else steers off the leader, which is why a group stays together over a route none of its members but one is reading, and why a group whose leader dies stops navigating — the leader is whatever `group+0x0c`'s slot 0 names, and the member array is not compacted.

The squad-order branch belongs to [`ai-squadmates.md`](ai-squadmates.md); `mech+0x240` is that order's own destination.

### Drive to a point — `Ai_DriveToPoint` (`0041fac4`)

```
bearing = Math_HeadingToward(point, mech.position)
dist    = Math_GroundDistanceBetweenPoints(mech.position, point)     // 2D, ground plane only
speed   = mech+0x252 != 0 ? mech+0x252 : 0xaa
if (mech+0x23e != 0 && dist > 30000) { TurboPod_Engage(mech+0x317); speed = 0x100 }
Mech_LocomotionTick(mech, (bearing - mech.heading) >> 6, speed, 0)
return dist < 10000
```

Four things it fixes for everything downstream:

- **Steering is the bearing error divided by 64.** `Mech_LocomotionTick` clamps its turn axis at `±0x100`, so the stick is hard over at any error past 16384 BAM — a quarter turn — and proportional inside that. Every AI steering decision in the game is this expression.
- **Range is measured on the ground plane.** `Math_GroundDistanceBetweenPoints` (`004927c4`) subtracts and takes a 2D magnitude, so a waypoint on a hilltop is as near as one at its foot. Every range a *steering* decision is made on is this one; the 3D form, `Math_DistanceBetweenPoints` (`00492780`), reaches the navigation layer in exactly two places — the avoidance's machine sweep and `following`'s standoff, both below.
- **The cruise speed is per machine**, out of the mission file: `mech+0x252`, set at spawn from block 7's `+0x02` and zero in 91% of retail records. Zero means `0xaa`, about two thirds of the `0x100` that saturates a chassis' maximum.
- **Arrival is 10000 units** — 60 metres, and again on the ground plane.

`Ai_DriveToPoint`'s Turbo Pod sprint fires only under a standing squad order, so nothing a machine does on mission orders sprints it to a waypoint however far it has to walk. It is not the pod's only user: `Mech_BehaviourFleeThink` (`0041d3a4`) engages it with no gate at all, which is the one place in the AI a pod fires on mission orders. Both call sites reach `mech+0x317` and there is no third; the pod's own speed bonus belongs to [`mech-locomotion.md`](mech-locomotion.md).

### Follow the route — `Ai_FollowRoute` (`0041fb60`)

```
next = Route_WaypointAt(group.routeCursor, group.routeCursor.index + 1)
if (next == null)                      Mech_LocomotionTick(mech, 0, 0, 0)     // stand
else if (Ai_DriveToPoint(mech, next))  Route_AdvanceCursor(group.routeCursor)
```

The whole route mechanism for a walking AI machine. It always drives at the waypoint **after** the cursor, so the cursor names the last one reached and a fresh group walks at waypoint 1, not waypoint 0.

`Route_AdvanceCursor` (`0042313c`) has four callers, and all four hand it the same `group+0x04` — every class that walks a route steps the cursor of the group it belongs to, at its own arrival range:

| Caller | Arrival | |
|---|---|---|
| `Ai_FollowRoute` (`0041fb99`) | 10000 | this layer |
| `Mech_BehaviourPlayerThink` (`0041c208`) | 10000 | announces it: [`player-waypoints.md`](player-waypoints.md) |
| `Flyer_LeadRouteStep` (`00422539`) | 15000 | [`ai-flyers.md`](ai-flyers.md) |
| `GroundVehicle_LeaderSteer` (`0046a93d`) | `GroundVehicle_DriveToPoint`'s own | [`structure-behaviour.md`](structure-behaviour.md) |

A route that runs out leaves the machine standing on the spot with its throttle at zero — and, through `Group_IsOrderComplete`, ends the order. The cursor wraps to zero on a closed route, so a patrol never runs out and a patrol order never completes; see [`ai-goals.md`](ai-goals.md#the-route-cursor-is-loaded-once).

### Keep formation — `Ai_KeepFormation` (`0041fbb8`)

Steers off the group leader rather than off the route. The post is the leader's position with **this machine's own formation-slot offset** applied through `Mech_ApplyFormationOffset` (mech vtable `+0x78`) — the same offset and the same rotation-by-the-leader's-heading that placed it at spawn, so the formation turns with the leader instead of being a fixed set of world points. `dist` throughout is the ground-plane range to that post.

| Condition | Turn | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| `dist < 2000` | `-(mech.heading - leader.heading) >> 6` | 0 |
| `dist ≤ 25000`, leader moving, heading error under `0x2000` | bearing error, plus the lateral offset in the leader's frame `>> 5` | `leader.speed + (-longitudinal >> 5)` |
| `dist ≤ 25000`, leader moving, heading error `0x2000` or more | `±0x100` | `-0x100` |
| otherwise | bearing error `>> 6` | `dist >> 7`, or `0x100` past 25000 |

- **On station it matches the leader's heading, not its bearing to the post** — that is what keeps a stopped formation dressed rather than pointing inward.
- **In motion it flies formation properly.** The delta from the post is rotated into the leader's frame by transposing the leader's Q14 rotation matrix (`Math_TransposeRotation2D`, `0047ddf8`), giving a lateral and a longitudinal error; lateral steers, longitudinal trims the speed off the leader's own. This is the only place in the AI that works in anything but bearings and ranges.
- **A member facing more than 45° away from the leader backs out of it**, turning hard while reversing at full throttle, rather than driving a wide arc.
- "The leader is moving" is `leader.speed` outside `[-25, 24]`, so a leader that has stopped puts every member back on the plain close-the-gap arm.

## Obstacle avoidance — `Mech_AiObstacleAvoidance` (`00416274`)

Not a think function: `Mech_LocomotionTick` calls it on every machine that is not the player, with pointers to the turn axis and the desired speed it was handed, so it amends a decision already made rather than making one. It runs on the player's squadmates as much as on the enemy.

It is skipped entirely when the machine is stopped *and* being asked to stay stopped, and when the desired speed is negative unless the unstick timer is running.

The whole function reduces to two numbers, `nearLeft` and `nearRight` — the range to the closest obstruction on each side, both starting at 22000 for "nothing there". Three sources feed them.

### The two probes

Two 20000-unit segments in body space, splaying outward:

```
left :  (-1500, 0, 0)  ->  (-10000, 20000, 0)
right:  ( 1500, 0, 0)  ->  ( 10000, 20000, 0)
```

Each is transformed to world space, flattened onto the machine's own terrain height, and tested twice: against shapes by `Sim_RaycastShapes` (`00404ca0`) and against the ground by `Terrain_RayWalk`. Whichever hit is nearer becomes that side's number.

`Sim_RaycastShapes` collects candidates before it casts (`Sim_RaycastShapeList`, `00404bc0`), and the filter is the interesting half. It is the **same test `Base_GetCollisionRadius` (`004035b8`) uses**, read the other way round: `typeRec+0x06` zero means a static structure, which always counts, and anything animated — a structure with an animation, or a machine — counts **only once it is a wreck**.

So the two sources are exact complements rather than overlapping. What has a collision radius is what the proximity sweep below sees, and it is precisely what this probe skips: a standing animated structure, and every live machine.

**The ground half is `Terrain_RayWalk`'s mode 1, and it has to be.** The probes lie flat on the surface, so mode 0 — the thin ray, which reports the ground wherever the segment is at or below it — would graze on every tick of rolling terrain and pin the steer hard over. Mode 1 asks a different question at each cell the segment crosses: is the face it is crossing one movement can pass? `Terrain_FaceBlocksMovement` (`0046fe40`) answers it from the face normal's upward component alone — under `0x60e` at `0x800` scale, about 41° of slope, is a wall and stops the segment; anything shallower does not. So the probes see cliffs and nothing else. The threshold sits just *shallower* than `Mech_CollisionTest`'s own `0x5aa`, which is what gives a machine a band of slope it will steer away from before the move is refused outright.

### Other machines

A linear sweep of the live-object list. A candidate is weighed when it is not this machine, its group has entered the mission, and its collision radius (vtable `+0x7c`) is non-zero — which for a machine is `typeRec+0x70`, 750 on all 21 chassis, so the test only ever rejects the structures the probes already cover.

**This range is taken in three dimensions** — `Math_DistanceBetweenPoints` (`0041662f`), not the ground form every steering decision uses; `following`'s standoff is the layer's only other. It is then scaled by `Q10(2000, d)` — very nearly twice the true distance, so a machine reads as an obstruction from twice as far as its actual range — and if that lands inside 45° of dead ahead it claims whichever side it lies on. A machine on a rise therefore reads as further off than the steer would otherwise make it.

### The player's line of fire

The third source runs only for a machine whose group is **led by the player**, and what it reads is `DAT_004a9c0c`: a trail of up to 40 points that `Mech_PlayerFireTick` (`00415608`) stamps along the player's turret bearing every time the trigger produces a shot, spaced `0x1000` apart and cut to the range of the player's selected target. The array has exactly three references in the image: `maybe_MechModule_StaticInit` (`0041bcac`) builds it — 40 elements of 8 bytes, which is where the cap comes from — `Mech_PlayerFireTick` writes it, and this function reads it. Nothing draws it.

**So the squad gets out of the player's line of fire.** These points are scaled by `Q10(1000, d)` — near enough the true range — and claim a side inside a wider 67.5° arc than a machine does. Not firing zeroes the count, so the line exists only while the player is actually shooting.

### Resolving it

```
if (unstickActive && nothing found)        take a quarter off the committed side's range
if (unstickActive && both sides found)     nearLeft += mech+0x254
steerAway = nearLeft <= nearRight
closest   = min(nearLeft, nearRight)
gain      = (source was the firing line) ? 1000 : 700
turn     += ±((22000 - closest) * gain / 22000)
```

The steer is added to the think function's own, and it grows linearly from nothing at 22000 to the full gain on contact. `0x100` is the axis' stop, so 700 is already well past hard-over: the avoidance overwhelms the navigation whenever an obstruction is inside about a third of the probe length.

**The speed is only ever cut for the player's firing line.** The threshold that gates the speed override is 3000 for a firing-line point and 0 for everything else, so terrain and machines are steered around at unchanged throttle, and only walking into the player's shots makes a squadmate stop — at full reverse.

### The unstick manoeuvre

Avoidance is prediction; this is what happens when it fails. `Mech_MovementTick` (`0041a360`), on a refused move and only for a machine that is not the player:

```
mech+0x26e = 10000                       // a 10 s timer at mech+0x26d
mech+0x254 = rand & 1 ? -5000 : 5000     // a side, picked by coin flip
mech+0xae  = (mech.speed > 0)            // back out if it was going forward
```

For those ten seconds `Mech_LocomotionTick` ignores the desired speed it was handed and runs the machine at its chassis maximum — reverse if `+0xae` is set, forward if not — while `mech+0x254` biases the avoidance to the side the coin chose. The bias is applied two ways: it breaks the tie when both sides are blocked, and when *neither* side reports anything it invents a 25% closer reading on the chosen side so the machine still turns.

## The navigation states

Six of the 22 states are navigation rather than combat — 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15 — across five think functions, since `travelling` and `bulldog travel` share one. Every one of them returns zero unconditionally, so none ever ends itself: a movement order ends through `Group_IsOrderComplete`, never through its think.

### `patrolling` (8) — `Mech_BehaviourPatrolThink` (`0041d7d0`)

`Ai_NavigationStep`, then the target drops, and then a gate: **a machine that is not the group leader, has no standing squad order and has not been told to fire at will returns here and does nothing else.** It does not even hold a target — the drop is above the gate — so by default the leader is the group's only scout. The squad verb is sampled *before* the movement, which can clear it. `mech+0xb6` is `FIRE AT WILL` and is what buys a follower the right to scout; see [`ai-squadmates.md`](ai-squadmates.md).

That is not the same as a follower never fighting. Two things reach one: `Mech_AiOnTakingFire`, and the combat reassess's leader sweep, which the leader's own think triggers the moment it finds something. **A member dragged in that way acquires its own target**, through its own `Ai_SelectTarget` on the same branch the leader took; it never reads the leader's `mech+0x1a4`. So a follower cannot *notice* a fight, only join one — and the acquisition score's crowding divisor then spreads the group across targets rather than onto the leader's. See [`ai-targeting.md`](ai-targeting.md).

Past the gate, on a 10 s timer in the behaviour block's scratch (`mech+0x5a`):

- A machine that is out of action (`+0xa5`, `+0xa4` or `+0x99`) acquires a target and takes `fleeing`.
- Otherwise it acquires only when the group order verb is 3 or the squad order verb is 2 — the two that actually mean patrol — with the mission-target-only filter, and hands what it finds to `Mech_AiEnterCombat`.

### `search/destroy` (12) — `Mech_BehaviourSearchDestroyThink` (`0041d60c`)

The same shape and the same gate less its squad-verb term — only leadership and `mech+0xb6` open this one — with one difference that is the whole state: what it acquires must pass `Group_IsOrderTarget`. **A search-and-destroy group fights only what its order names** and walks past everything else. The flee arm is as in `patrolling`.

### `travelling` (9) and `bulldog travel` (11) — `Mech_BehaviourTravelThink` (`0041d9cc`)

`Ai_FollowRoute` **directly**, not `Ai_NavigationStep` — so in this one state every member reads the route itself and every member can advance the shared cursor. Formation is not held while travelling; the members' spawn offsets are all that keeps them apart.

That also means the cursor can be stepped several times in a tick, once by each member that is within 10000 of the waypoint the previous step just made current. A tightly-packed group crossing a dense stretch of route skips through it faster than one machine would.

It then drops its target, and on the same 10 s timer acquires one into `mech+0x5f` — a *look-at*, not a target: it is never written to `mech+0x1a4`. It is nonetheless **shot at**: the state closes with `Ai_AimAndFire`, the same tail the combat states use, so a machine walking a route engages what it watches without ever selecting it. See [`ai-weapons.md`](ai-weapons.md). The radar (`mech+0x96`) goes ACTIVE whenever there is something to watch.

### `following` (10) — `Mech_BehaviourFollowThink` (`0041daac`)

Identical but for its first two lines: instead of a route it drives at `Group_OrderTargetObject`'s position, and it stops at 25000 rather than closing to 10000. **That 25000 is the layer's other three-dimensional range** — `Math_DistanceBetweenPoints` at `0041dad3` — so a machine holds further back from something above or below it than from something level with it.

Nothing here touches the route cursor, and verb 6's completion test is a route test — so **a `following` order can only ever complete on a group whose route was already empty**. The group can still leave the order without completing it, through the action path in `Group_OrderTick`; see [`ai-goals.md`](ai-goals.md).

### `guarding` (15) — `Mech_BehaviourGuardThink` (`0041e224`)

The post is `Mech_AiGoalPosition` (`0041dbcc`). A player squadmate with no standing order skips the whole state and holds formation instead. Everything else works a standoff ring, on ground range to the post — and the defence acquisition also runs for a machine told to fire at will, taking the standing engage order's own target (`mech+0x248`) when there is one in place of `Ai_SelectDefenceTarget`'s pick:

| Range | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| over 30000 | `Ai_DriveToPoint` at the post |
| 10000–30000 | stand still, turning to face **away** from the post |
| under 10000 | walk away from the post at `0x100` |

The half-turn in the steering term (`bearing - heading - 0x8000`) is what makes a guard face outward. The ring is the state's entire movement; there is no patrol of the perimeter.

Its target handling is the exception among the five: it runs `Ai_SelectDefenceTarget` (`0041e0e0`) against the post rather than a plain acquisition, and installs `driving off en` (16) on what it finds, or `fleeing` (18) if it is itself out of action.

## Line of sight — `Ai_LineOfSightBlocked` (`0041dc24`)

Not navigation, but it is built out of the same two probe primitives, and it is what sends a machine into `skirting` (14). Both endpoints are lifted to their objects' aim-node origins, or by 500 units when there is no node, and then:

```
steep    = Terrain_RayWalk(from, to, mode 1)          // is a face in the way too steep to walk
if (Sim_RaycastShapes(from, to) hit something that is not the target) return 1
if (!Terrain_RayWalk(from, to, mode 0))               return 0      // the ground is clear
return steep ? 1 : 2
```

**The two nonzero answers are not "shape" and "terrain".** `1` is anything the machine cannot get past — a shape, or ground whose slope `Terrain_FaceBlocksMovement` says it could not walk. `2` is ground it *could* walk: the thin ray grazes a rise the machine can simply crest. That is what makes the reading matter to the one consumer — see [`ai-combat-states.md`](ai-combat-states.md#skirting-14--mech_behaviourskirtthink-0041dd64), which owns the state.

## Mech and mission fields this layer owns

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `+0xae` | byte | Unstick direction: reverse out rather than push forward |
| `+0x254` | short | Unstick side, `±5000` |
| `+0x26d` | timer | The 10 s unstick window; its counter is the int at `+0x26e` |
| `+0x252` | short | AI cruise speed, from block 7 `+0x02`. Zero means `0xaa` |
| `+0x5a` | timer | The navigation states' own 10 s decision clock, in the behaviour block's scratch |
| `+0x5f` | ptr | What `travelling` and `following` point the turret at. Not a selected target |
| `+0x97` | byte | The mission file's standing radar setting for this machine, from block 7 `+0x00` — [`ai-weapons.md`](ai-weapons.md) |
| `+0x96` | byte | Radar mode, written here from `+0x97`, or from `+0xb2` in the player's squad — [`ai-weapons.md`](ai-weapons.md) |
| `+0xb6` | byte | `FIRE AT WILL` — lets a non-leader run the patrol, search-and-destroy and guard thinks. Written by [`ai-squadmates.md`](ai-squadmates.md) |

Block 7's `+0x00` and `+0x02` are `.MSN` row #12's `+0x08` and `+0x0a`; see [`msn-mission-file.md`](../formats/msn-mission-file.md) and [`script-dat.md`](../formats/script-dat.md).

## Engine port

`MechObject.Navigation.cs` holds the four primitives, the avoidance and the five thinks; `MissionGroup` owns the route cursor and its wrap. The think slot is dispatched from `MechObject.AiTick`, which until this slice ran the reassess alone.

What differs from the original, and why:

- **The shape probe stops at the bounding radius.** The original casts a swept volume against each candidate's shape; the engine has no such cast, so the probe takes the coarse reject that cast opens with — the candidate's bounding radius against the segment's closest approach. It reports a structure from slightly further out than its shape would, which errs toward steering earlier. It cannot be left out: a static structure's collision radius is zero, and so is a wrecked animated one, so the proximity sweep never sees either and a machine walks into one and stands there for the rest of the mission.
- **The machine sweep's range is the ground one.** The original's is 3D. The two agree on level ground and the sweep reads a machine on a rise as further off than the engine does, so the engine steers around it marginally earlier.
- **The mode-1 hit point is the walk's own point for the step**, not the refinement `FUN_0046fcac` solves against the blocking face. Both callers only measure a range from it, and the two differ by less than a cell.

## Open questions

- **Descriptor `+0x3c`** groups `skirting` and `ramming` with the combat states against the rest of the navigation roster, which is a stronger distinction than its one reader needs; see [`ai-dispatch.md`](ai-dispatch.md).
- **Why the firing line is the only source that cuts speed.** The distance thresholds for the other two are zero, which reads more like an unfinished tuning pass than a decision.

## Rejected readings

| Reading | Why it is wrong |
|---|---|
| `Mech_MovementTick`, the move slot 18 states share, is where AI movement happens | It integrates and collides; it steers nothing. Every AI steering decision is a think function calling `Mech_LocomotionTick` |
| `DAT_004a9c0c` is the HUD's lead-indicator trail | Nothing draws it. Its three references are the static initialiser that builds it, `Mech_PlayerFireTick`'s write and `Mech_AiObstacleAvoidance`'s read — it is a friendly-fire keep-out line, not a display |
| Obstacle avoidance has a mirrored mode for a machine walking backwards | It has the code for one — a flag that flips the probe length negative and rotates every bearing test by a half turn — and the flag is written zero at the top of the function and never anywhere else. The half-speed arm of the speed override is unreachable for the same reason |
| The whole group follows the route | Only the group leader does, through `Ai_NavigationStep`. The exception is `travelling`, which bypasses that chooser entirely and has every member reading the route at once |
| A `following` order ends when the group reaches what it is following | Its completion test is the route test the other two movement verbs use, and nothing in `following` advances the route cursor |
| Every navigation range is the ground one | Every range a *steer* is computed from is, which is the bulk of them and the reason a hilltop waypoint is as near as its foot. Two ranges that only gate a decision are 3D: the avoidance's machine sweep and `following`'s standoff |
| `Sim_RaycastShapes`' filter turns on whether the candidate moves | `typeRec+0x06` is a machine's top speed and a structure's animated flag, and the probe wants the second reading. A standing *animated* structure is skipped here and picked up by the collision-radius sweep instead |
