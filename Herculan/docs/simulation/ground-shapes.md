# Ground shapes and HERC shadows — `FlatObj` (DBSIM.EXE)

Addresses are DBSIM virtual addresses.

A ground shape is a flat shape lying on the terrain. Most of them are HERC shadows: a dark octagon under each foot and one under the body, which follow the machine as it walks. The rest are the square a drop pod leaves where it lands, and a growing ring an impact effect can lay, though no retail effect asks for it. All of them are one class, `FlatObj` (Borland RTTI at `0041bcf6`, `0x41` bytes, type tag 9 at `obj+0x04`), out of one pool, `g_FlatObjPool` (`004a9711`, Borland `ObjPool<FlatObj>`, 150 entries), each drawing one root of the theater's flat shape set.

## The shape set — `FlatObj_LoadResources` (`004097a8`)

`World_LoadTheater` (`0042e010`) ends with it, passing `World_FlatSetSelector` (`0049aeea`), the tenth `int16` of `wld\world<N>.wld` (byte 18). Zero selects the set `flat`, anything else `flat2`. It loads `dts\<set>` through `Shape_LoadAllRoots` into `g_FlatShapes` (`004a971c`, count `004a9720`), packs `dba\<set>` with `BitmapArray_PackToAtlas` into `004a9726` and points every root's bound-bank field `+0x26` at `004a9722` ([`../formats/dts-texture-binding.md`](../formats/dts-texture-binding.md#dba-binding)). Then it builds the pool (`Pool_Init`, 150 × `0x41`) and `g_FlatObjDeleteQueue` (`004a9715`): an 8-byte header over a 100-byte pointer array, capacity `0x19` at `+6`.

All ten retail `.WLD` files hold 1, and only `FLAT2.DTS` and `FLAT2.DBA` ship. `FLAT2.DTS` has four roots, each a single group; sizes are in world units, and every root lies in its model XY plane:

| Root | Geometry | Extent | Radius | Laid by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | one `TSSolidPoly` octagon, palette 224 | 300 across, 968 along model Y, 100 ahead of its origin at the centre | 490 | a HERC, the shadow under each foot |
| 1 | a five-cell `TSCellAnimPart` of `TSSolidPoly` octagons: half-widths 1024 (96), 1536 (96), 2048 (96) round 1024 (97), 2048 (97), 1536 (97) | up to 4096 | 2290 | an impact effect |
| 2 | one `TSSolidPoly` octagon, palette 224 | 1364 across, 768 along | 709 | a HERC, the shadow under its body |
| 3 | one `TSTexture4Poly` square, frame 0 of `FLAT2.DBA` | 4000 | 2829 | a landed drop pod |

The radius is the root's own `shape+8`, which `SimObject_GetShapeRadius` (`0046b80c`) reports and the draw's terrain conform probes at ([The draw pass](#the-draw-pass)).

## The class

| Vtable slot | `FlatObj_Vtable` (`0049a262`) |
|---|---|
| `+0x00` | `FlatObj_Draw` (`0040991c`) |
| `+0x04` | `SimObject_GetPosition` (`0046b801`), `obj+0x26` |
| `+0x08` | `FlatObj_Destruct` (`0041bd46`) |
| `+0x0c` | `Stub_ReturnZero` (`004785bf`) |
| `+0x10` | `SimObject_GetShapeRadius` (`0046b80c`) |

**It has no tick.** Of the nine references `es2_xref.py` finds to `g_FlatObjPool`, seven are code — the loader, `FlatObj_RegisterSubsystem` (`00409940`, which nulls it at static init), `Sim_FlushDeleteQueue`, the three spawners and the draw pass — and the draw pass is the only one that walks the pool. A shape moves only when its HERC moves it.

Every spawner inlines the same construction after `Pool_Alloc` (`00471a24`): `SimObjectBase_Constructor(obj, g_FlatShapes[root])`, which zeroes the position and the euler angles and builds a fresh shape instance, then the vtable and tag 9. **None of the three checks the allocation.** Each skips the construction on a null, then writes the position through the pointer anyway (`Meteor_Tick` from `00409e03`, `Explosion_Construct` at `0040802f`, `Mech_Constructor` at `00415efb`), so a spawn into a full pool faults.

## A HERC's shadows

`Mech_Constructor` (`00415bb0`, `00415e25`-`00415f11`) counts the type record's byte list at `+0x72` up to its first negative byte into `mech+0x23c`, allocates that many pointers at `mech+0x238`, and builds one shadow per entry, the byte naming the root. Each is built at z = −100000 (`00415efb`), out of the draw's range from anywhere until it is first placed.

The same entries drive the footfalls: the byte at `+0x72` is also the entry's kind, and `typeRec+0x77` names the shape part it follows.

| Chassis | `+0x72` (root and kind) | `+0x77` (part) |
|---|---|---|
| every HERC but the two below | 0, 0, 2 | 14, 15, 12 |
| PITBULL | 0, 0, 0, 0 | 14, 15, 22, 23 |
| SPIDER | none | — |

So a biped casts three shadows: one under each foot and one under part 12, its body. The count is the list's, not `ModelLegsTotal` (`typeRec+0x4a`, 2 on a biped).

**Placement** is the first half of each pass of `Mech_PlaceLegsOnGround`'s loop (`004195c8`), run from `Mech_MovementTick` and `Mech_BehaviourRamTick` every movement tick. For each entry still holding a shadow it resolves the part's node through the shape instance, puts the node's translation through the machine's frame (`Transform_ApplyToPoint`) into the shadow's position, copies the machine's heading (euler `+0x10`) and clears the shadow's matrix-valid flag. That runs for every entry whatever the machine is doing; the footfall tests after it are the loop's other half ([`mech-locomotion.md`](mech-locomotion.md)). The draw then presses each shadow onto the ground under its part, so the shadows follow the feet and the body through a walk, a fall and the wreck.

**Loss.** The leg branch of `Mech_ComponentDamageWrite` (`00418144`-`00418190`) queues a leg's shadow for deletion (`ObjectPool_QueueForDelete`) and nulls its slot when that leg's servo reading is `0x100`, so that foot casts no shadow, and `Mech_PlaceLegsOnGround` skips the entry from then on, footfall included ([`component-damage.md`](component-damage.md#going-out-of-the-fight)). The no-wreck branch queues every entry, and the SPIDER, the one chassis it runs for, has none ([`component-damage.md`](component-damage.md#going-out-of-the-fight)). `es2_fieldscan.py` finds `mech+0x238` read by those two branches, the constructor and `Mech_PlaceLegsOnGround`, and written only by the constructor.

## An impact effect's shape

`Explosion_Construct` (`00407f1c`, `00407fc5`-`0040804c`) lays root 1 at the effect's point when the `EXPLOS.DAT` row's `+0x04` is nonzero, keeping the pointer at `effect+0x4f` ([`../formats/explos-dat.md`](../formats/explos-dat.md#type-row-0x28-bytes)). `Explosion_TickUpdate` (`0040813c`) steps the shape's sequence-0 cell each time it steps its own frame to a nonzero one, modulo the shape's own cell count, so the ring grows through its five cells beside the flipbook. The effect's destructor, `Explosion_Destruct` (`00407e48`), queues the shape for deletion with the effect.

**No retail row sets `+0x04`**: it is 0 on all 22 rows of both `EXPLOS.DAT` and `EXPLOS2.DAT`, so root 1 is never drawn in a retail mission.

## A drop pod's shape

`Meteor_Tick` (`00409d2c`) lays root 3 at the pod's landing point once the pod has finished opening, whenever the pod carried a group, delivered or not ([`mission-deployment.md`](mission-deployment.md#the-drop-pod--meteor)). The heading is 0 and the pod keeps no pointer, so nothing frees it: the square stays for the rest of the mission.

## The draw pass

`Scene_SubmitFrameObjects` (`0042841c`) walks the pool first every frame, from the tail with `Pool_Prev` (`00471b64`), which is oldest first: `Pool_Alloc` puts each new node at the head of the in-use list. A shape whose position is under 30000 from the view object's by `Math_DistanceBetweenPoints` goes through `Scene_SubmitObject` (`004282d8`) to `Scene_SubmitObjectWithRadius` (`0042837c`), which files it under the cell `HeightGrid_PickDrawCell` (`0046e528`) picks from its position and radius: its own cell, or the next one toward the viewer when the shape reaches over that edge ([`../formats/terrain-drawing.md`](../formats/terrain-drawing.md#heightgrid_pickdrawcell-0046e528)). The pick reads the position before the draw conforms it, so a HERC's shadows are measured at their part's height.

**Tag 9 is drawn on the spot.** The terrain is painted a cell at a time in the walk's fixed order ([`../formats/terrain-drawing.md`](../formats/terrain-drawing.md#the-cell-walk--terrain_drawvisiblecells-0046d0a4)), and each cell's objects straight after its ground. `ObjList_DrawCellObjects` (`00428c60`) turns every other object into a depth-sorted render entry and draws those at the end of the cell, but calls a tag-9 object's draw slot at once, in filing order, with the ramp's row count `DAT_004a5b1c` zeroed around it. So a ground shape is painted over its own cell's ground, and over whatever else is already on the screen where it lands, before anything else in its cell; every cell the walk paints later paints over it. It fogs with the fade its cell's quad installed ([`../formats/distance-fog-and-sky.md`](../formats/distance-fog-and-sky.md#what-gets-faded)). The zeroed row count makes root 3's textured face a plain palette copy, with no light term and no fog ([`../formats/dts-texture-binding.md`](../formats/dts-texture-binding.md#tstexture4poly--frame-index-ramp-row-by-light-fullbright-on-demand)); the solid roots are unlit anyway. A shape the pick puts off the grid is drawn after all the ground, from the no-cell bucket ([`../formats/terrain-drawing.md`](../formats/terrain-drawing.md#after-the-walk--objlist_drawafterterrain-0042883c)).

`FlatObj_Draw` (`0040991c`) conforms the shape to the terrain with `SimObject_ConformToTerrain` (`004029d8`), then installs its model transform and draws its shape instance. The conform samples the ground at the shape's radius forward, back, left and right in its own frame and sets its pitch, roll and Z from them ([`structure-behaviour.md`](structure-behaviour.md#the-ground-vehicle-tick--0046a5d0)), so the shape lies on a plane through four ground samples, not on the terrain's own surface. The result stays on the object, and the next conform rotates its probes through the pitch and roll this one left.

## Lifetimes

Deletion goes through `g_FlatObjDeleteQueue`. `Sim_FlushDeleteQueue` (`00409904`) runs `ObjectPool_FlushDeleteQueue` over it, which calls `FlatObj_Destruct` and `Pool_Free` on each entry. `FlatObj_RegisterSubsystem` registers the flush at subsystem phase 5, which `maybe_Sim_RenderFrame` runs at the start of every frame's draw (`0045fba5`), and `Mech_ComponentDamageWrite` calls it at its end. A queued shape is therefore never drawn again.

`ObjectPool_QueueForDelete` (`0047851c`) appends without testing the capacity at `+6`, so a 26th deletion between two flushes would write past the array. A damage write queues at most four and flushes at its end, and only an impact effect's end queues from the tick, which no retail row can reach.

## Rejected readings

| Reading | Why it is wrong |
|---|---|
| `EXPLOS.DAT`'s `+0x04` attaches a trail object at `effect+0x4f` | It lays a `FlatObj` on the ground: root 1 of the flat set, stepped with the effect and deleted with it |
| `mech+0x238` holds a HERC's legs as child objects | They are its shadows, `FlatObj`s drawn from the flat set; the legs are nodes of the machine's own shape |
| The HERC part list runs for `ModelLegsTotal` entries | `Mech_Constructor` counts to the list's first negative byte: three on a biped, the third the body's |
| `SimObject_ConformToTerrain` is the ground vehicle's alone | `FlatObj_Draw` calls it on every ground shape it draws |
| A shadow lies on the terrain's surface, so it only has to beat the ground under it by a little depth | It is a flat plane through four ground samples, and on uneven ground it passes under the terrain and over it. What keeps it visible is the paint order: it is drawn after its own cell's ground and before every nearer cell's |

## Open

- **Open:** `bnd\FLAT.BND`, which ships beside the `FLAT2` pair, has not been examined.
- **Open:** whether a RAZOR's shadows are ever placed. It carries the biped list, but its flight states' move is `Razor_MovementTick` ([`razor-flight.md`](razor-flight.md)), which does not call `Mech_PlaceLegsOnGround`; while it flies its shadows stay at their build depth.
- **Unported:** a ground shape painting over an object filed under a cell the walk painted earlier, where the two overlap on screen.
