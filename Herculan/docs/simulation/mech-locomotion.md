# Herc locomotion — throttle, steering, and animation root motion

Reverse-engineered from `DBSIM.EXE` (`mechsys.cpp`) in the `ES2Recon` Ghidra project. Covers ground Hercs only. The Razor (`typeRec+0x50 != 0`) takes different paths throughout — a different control law, a different move and a real velocity vector; see [`razor-flight.md`](razor-flight.md).

**Core fact: Hercs have no velocity vector.** All translation and all turn-in-place rotation come from the walk/run/turn animations' root-node motion. The control law only sets a speed scalar, a turn rate, and an animation playback rate.

How the slot is reached, and which states differ, is in [`ai-dispatch.md`](ai-dispatch.md).

### Load-time speed rescale

`MechType_InitOne` rescales four speed fields for non-flyers:

```
scale  = Q16Divide(rec196 × 400, rec194)
typeRec+0x04, +0x06, +0x2e, +0x6e  ×= scale     (Q16)
typeRec+0x02 (turn rate) is NOT rescaled
typeRec+0xc2 = Q10(315 × rawSpeedForward)       computed BEFORE the rescale
```

`scale` normalises the designer's speed points to the model's stride length: `simMax × stridePerTick` tracks `rawSpeedForward` across every Herc (see verification below). It is not friction.

The HUD reads `speed × typeRec[0xc2] / typeRec[0x06]` (`Mech_GetDisplaySpeedKph`, `0041bb3c`, walker branch; the flyer branch is in [`razor-flight.md`](razor-flight.md)), so `simMax` cancels and top speed always displays `315 × rawSpeedForward / 1024` regardless of scale.

## Control law (`Mech_LocomotionTick`)

Speed:

```
throttle += Q8(0x91, -stickAxis)                  // 0.566/tick, clamp ±0x400
desired   = Q10(throttle < 0 ? maxRev : maxFwd, throttle)
desired  += slopeTerm                             // dot(terrainNormal, forward) / 2400
desired   = clamp(desired, maxRev, maxFwd)
RateLimitedMoveToward(speed, desired, typeRec[0x08])
```

`DAT_0049a06e` is **not** a gear selector. `Input_SetThrottleLeverMode` (`00459d20`) sets it to 1 only when the input configuration reports a throttle control *and* the preferences page has that control assigned to THROTTLE rather than TURRET, and to 0 otherwise; the key command and the cockpit slider that "toggle" it only ever flip between +1 and −1, gated on that same pair. It selects the **joystick throttle-lever mode**: 0 = none, ±1 = lever present, sign inverting its sense.

It matters because it is what gates the throttle clamp. At 0 — keyboard and plain stick — the range is the full ±0x400, so holding the axis against its stop runs the setting from full forward through a one-tick pause at zero and on into full reverse. That one-tick pause is the sign-crossing guard, and it is the manual's "Centered is stopped". Non-zero also switches the handler's first block on, which reads the axis as an absolute lever position (`|axis − 0x100| × 2`, deadbanded below 100) instead of as a rate.

The throttle is two-way bound to the cockpit throttle gauge, arbitrated by the `mech+0x93` dirty flag — see [`cockpit-hud-widgets.md`](../formats/cockpit-hud-widgets.md).

Turn rate — a symmetric tent over speed, `T` the max turn rate (`typeRec+0x02`):

```
if (inStopAnim || speed == 0) turnBase = 0
else {
    s = clamp(|speed| bumped to min 45, 45, maxFwd);  H = (maxFwd - 45) / 2
    turnBase = (s <= 45+H) ? T·(s-45+H)/(2H)
                           : T - T·(s-45-H)/(2H)
}
turnTarget = Q8(Q10(1600, turnBase), stickAxis)    // stick clamped ±0x100
RateLimitedMoveToward(turnRate, turnTarget, typeRec[0x0a])
heading += turnRate
```

Half turn rate at crawl, peak at half top speed, half again at top speed. `Q16Divide(0x32, 0x32)` in that branch is a dead constant (always 1.0).

**Turning in place is not produced here** — at zero speed `turnBase` is 0. The turn-in-place branch only sets the animation rate to `Q10(350, stickAxis)`; the rotation comes from the turn-in-place sequence's root rotation.

The remainder of `Mech_LocomotionTick` (~60% of its body) is the gait state machine, switching between the walk / run / stop-forward / stop-reverse / turn-in-place / death sequences and maintaining `mech+0x2a0`. In steady state `animRate = speed`.

## Center Body

The manual's other half of [Backspace]: instead of bringing the turret back to the legs, it walks the legs round under the turret. Scancode `0x2b` (`Sim_DispatchCommand`, `0045fdac`, and the identical case in `Sim_PollPlayerInput`) latches `g_CenterBodyMode` (`004d2af4`), clears `g_CenterTurretMode` and the ATT flag, and caches

```
g_CenterBodyTargetHeading = heading - Mech_GetTorsoTwistAngle()    // 004d2af8, short
```

— the world direction the turret is pointing in. While latched, the player's input block substitutes its own steering and twist axis; the throttle and the pitch axis still come from the pilot.

```
bodyError   = heading - target                       // legs still to turn
turretError = (heading - twistAngle) - target        // turret drifted off the direction
steer = sign(a) x (a² >> 8),  a = Q10(100, bodyError)
twist = sign(b) x (b² >> 8),  b = Q10(0x46, turretError)
if (a² >> 8 < 0x1e && b² >> 8 < 10)  g_CenterBodyMode = 0
if (Mech_GetSpeed() < 0)  steer = -steer
Mech_ApplyThrottleInput(mech, steer, throttleAxis)
Mech_TorsoTwistTick(mech, twist);  Mech_TorsoPitchTick(mech, pitchAxis, range)
```

All 16-bit arithmetic, so both errors wrap. Squaring the gained error makes the command soft near the target and hard away from it, which is what stops the legs hunting; the sign is put back afterwards. Both terms reach their thresholds together, since heading meeting the target forces the twist to zero. The extra inversion on `Mech_GetSpeed` (mech vtable `+0x38`, `00415498` — `Q10(2000, mech+0x28e)`) sits on top of the one `Mech_ApplyThrottleInput` already does from the stick, so reversing steers the right way.

The mode is not cancelled by steering or by the turret axes — only by its own convergence test or by [Backspace]. It leaves a few degrees of residual twist, by design: it is not a centring command.

## Timing

Tick rate, the `SimTickDelta`/`DAT_004d3be8` formula (`Time_BeginSimTick`, `004677bc`), and its Q8/125ms scale are documented in [`dbsim-physics-notes.md`](dbsim-physics-notes.md#fixed-point-math-toolkit) — not repeated here.

The locomotion accel steps (`typeRec+0x08`, `+0x0a`) are raw per-tick steps with no `Math_IntegrateRateOverTick`, so **the control law is frame-rate dependent**. The animation advance and the torso rates *are* dt-scaled.

## Root motion

`SimObject_ApplyRootMotion` (`0040250c`), called once per tick from `Mech_IntegrateMotion`:

```c
setRootTransform(shape, IDENTITY);   // FUN_00478a70
advanceAnimation(shape, dt);         // ShapeInstance_StepAnimation (00478c2c), dt = Q8(SimTickDelta, 100)
delta = shape->nodeWorldTransforms[0];
pos   = objRotationMatrix × delta.translation + pos;   // Transform_ApplyToPoint (00480330)
euler += eulerOf(delta.rotation);                      // Transform_RotationToEuler (0047f894)
setRootTransform(shape, IDENTITY);
```

Per-frame ground movement is loaded on every frame advance by `AnimThread_LoadFrameGroundMovement` (`00478de8`):

```c
seq = animList->Sequences[seqId];
if (seq->groundMovementFlag == 0) thread.groundMoveFlag = 0;
else {
    G = animList->Transforms[ seq->transformIndices[frame * numParts] ];   // part index 0 = root
    thread.groundTrans = G.translation;   // thread+0x22/0x24/0x26
    thread.groundRot   = G.rotation;      // thread+0x28/0x2a/0x2c
    thread.groundMoveFlag = 1;            // thread+0x20
}
```

The sequence's ground-movement flag is the enable flag. A transition's transform index is a *different* field — a gait-change hook used only when switching sequences, not the steady gait.

Application is a matched set around the fraction `thread+0x1c / thread+0x1e` (intra-frame accumulator ÷ frame duration):

| Function | Effect |
|---|---|
| `00478fa8` | read: returns `scale(G, frac) ∘ stored` |
| `00479088` | write: `stored = scale(G, frac)⁻¹ ∘ incoming` |
| `00478e60` | frame exit: commits full `G` into `stored` |
| `00478ee8` | inverse of `00478e60`, for backward playback |

Seeding the root to identity then reading back yields `scale(G, frac_after) ∘ scale(G, frac_before)⁻¹` — the exact delta for that tick. Over one full frame the Herc advances by exactly `G`, ramped linearly. The node poses are blended by the same fraction — [Keyframe interpolation](../formats/dts-node-posing.md#keyframe-interpolation).

**Axes:** +Y is forward in model space (matches `Mech_ApplyTerrainSlopeToSpeed`, which builds the forward vector as `(0, speed, 0)`); root rotation Z is yaw.

### Resulting speed

```
animTicksPerSec = 3.125 × animRate
        because  dt        = Q8(SimTickDelta, 100) = 0.8 × elapsedMs
                 advance   = dt × animRate / 256           (AnimThread_Advance, 00479614)
                 per sec   = 1000 × 0.8 × animRate / 256

worldSpeed = 3.125 × speed × (ΣG_cycle / Σticks_cycle)     world units/sec
```

Frame-rate independent — `elapsedMs` cancels.

Because `G` varies frame to frame (OUTLAW walk: 150, 240, 170, 240, 80, 380 …), world speed **pulses with each footfall**, up to 4.75× between the slowest and fastest frame of a stride. Averaging `G` over the cycle loses that.

### Verification

Predicted run-gait top speed vs. the HUD reading, all Hercs, no fitted parameters:

| Herc | rawMax | scale | simMax | walk u/tick | run u/tick | pred km/h | HUD km/h | pred/HUD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OUTLAW | 325 | 0.851 | 276 | 2.092 | 5.080 | 94.6 | 100.0 | 0.947 |
| RAPTOR2 | 215 | 0.976 | 209 | 2.862 | 5.025 | 70.9 | 66.1 | 1.072 |
| TOMAHAWK | 240 | 1.180 | 283 | 2.025 | 4.140 | 79.1 | 73.8 | 1.071 |
| SAMSON | 190 | 1.078 | 204 | 2.200 | 4.460 | 61.4 | 58.4 | 1.051 |
| COLOSSUS | 180 | 0.911 | 164 | 2.325 | 5.140 | 56.9 | 55.4 | 1.028 |
| APOCA | 200 | 0.497 | 99 | 3.800 | 8.472 | 56.6 | 61.5 | 0.920 |
| OGRE | 190 | 0.874 | 166 | 2.775 | 5.375 | 60.2 | 58.4 | 1.030 |
| MAVERICK | 285 | 0.976 | 278 | 2.862 | 5.025 | 94.3 | 87.7 | 1.076 |
| SCARAB | 180 | 1.070 | 192 | 1.833 | 3.840 | 49.8 | 55.4 | 0.899 |

Full 18-Herc run: all within 0.899–1.076, mean ≈ 1.00. Four independent quantities must be correct for this to hold — root-motion model, the 3.125 tick constant, the load-time rescale, and the 166.667 units/m world scale. APOCA is the tightest constraint: stride 8.472 u/tick (largest) against scale 0.497 (smallest); without the rescale it is 2× wrong.

### Turn-in-place

Uniform across every Herc: 1820 units (10.00°) per frame, 7 frames, 100 ticks/frame = **70° per 700-tick cycle**, zero translation. At full stick `animRate = Q10(350, 256) = 87.5`, giving 27.3°/s (180° in 6.6 s). Negative stick plays the sequence backward.

## Walk/run gait discontinuity

Real and universal; confirmed against the retail build.

A run stride is ~2× a walk stride but takes 5/6 the time, and `animRate = speed` in both gaits. Crossing `typeRec+0x2e` therefore roughly doubles actual ground speed while the HUD number moves continuously. Per-Herc run/walk u/tick ratio: 1.76–2.43.

The HUD's 315/1024 constant is calibrated for the run gait only. Below the threshold — 50–60% of the throttle range — a Herc physically moves about half what the readout claims. See [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](../../KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

## Damage effects on movement

Three terms, applied to the speed the machine is *asking* for rather than to the speed it has, so a damaged machine still accelerates at its own rate. They sit after the obstacle-avoidance step, which writes a speed of its own.

- **The flat penalties**, one pair of thresholds over two independent conditions:

  | | 39% (`Q10 × 400`) | 73% (`Q10 × 750`) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Legs | `mech+0xa9` — a side at `0x8d` damage or worse | `mech+0xa8` — a side past `0x50` |
  | Reactor | `mech+0xab` critical | `mech+0xaa` degraded |

The severe pair wins outright where both apply. Both leg flags are written by the leg grading in [`component-damage.md`](component-damage.md); the reactor pair cuts power and mobility together — see [reactor-energy-pool.md](reactor-energy-pool.md#reactor-damage-flags).

- `mech+0x317` is the **Turbo Pod** (`TURB`, catalog id 31). While engaged it adds a term to desired speed *in the current direction of travel*, gated on `speed != 0`, so the pod accelerates a walk rather than starting one. The term is a speed bonus that degrades with the pod's damage and is maximal at full health. What engages it, what it costs the pool and the curve are in [`equipment-pods.md`](equipment-pods.md#what-the-turbo-pod-is-worth).

## Going down

`Mech_LocomotionTick`'s own branch for an **immobilised** machine, and the whole of how a HERC that has lost its legs ends up face down. It is an animation, not a physics result: there is no rigid body, no angular velocity and no ground-contact solve anywhere in the mech path, and the pitch you see is the last keyframe of a sequence.

Two things happen before the gait machine is even reached:

1. **The inputs are taken away.** Throttle and steer are zeroed, the unstick countdown does not run, the slope term and the clamp are skipped, and obstacle avoidance does not run. Everything below still runs, so the machine decelerates through the same rate limiter and walks its remaining momentum off over the next few ticks rather than stopping dead.
2. **The fall**, taken instead of the gait machine once the thread is settled — unless the machine is turning in place, which wins, so one immobilised mid-pirouette keeps turning.

| Thread state | What happens |
|---|---|
| Neither running nor targeting the death sequence (`typeRec+0x46`) | Aim playback at it with `AnimThread_SetTarget` (`00479570`) so the list's own transition is used; a machine in the reverse step-off is first snapped to the forward one, which is the only one with a transition to take. Sound `0x1e`. Rate 100 |
| Running it | Rate `0x78` |
| Running it, and `frame == nextFrame` | It has played out: latch `mech+0xb4` **collapsed**, take the landing damage, sound `0x29` |

The end-of-sequence test works only because the death sequence is the chassis' one **non-cyclic** sequence — see [`../formats/dts-node-posing.md`](../formats/dts-node-posing.md#cyclic-and-one-shot-sequences).

`mech+0xb4` is a third condition distinct from destroyed and immobilised, and the one that takes a machine off the AI's books completely: [`ai-targeting.md`](ai-targeting.md)'s targetability test and the mission group's condition test both reject a collapsed candidate, while one still falling is still a target.

The landing calls `Mech_SpreadImpactDamage` (`00417a04`) with `(150, 120)` — see [`component-damage.md`](component-damage.md#spread-impact-damage--mech_spreadimpactdamage-00417a04), which owns that primitive. A bad enough landing can therefore finish a machine off through the death gate.

`Mech_PlaceLegsOnGround` has a death-sequence arm of its own, but it leaves the sound id unset and so can never reach the footfall it guards.

## Cockpit eye and bob

No dedicated bob code, and none is needed. `typeRec+0x0c`, the camera node, is a shape **part** id. `Cockpit_TargetAnglesFromCameraBone` (`0041ef14`) resolves it through the shape's find-by-id, takes that part's `TSBasePart.Transform` as a transform id, and indexes the shape instance's per-node transform array at `shapeInst+0x16` (`0x20` bytes per entry) — the same array `SimObject_PushTransform` (`00402628`) memcpy's `count << 5` bytes of when saving state for a blocked step. The eye rides a node the walk cycle animates, so the bob falls out of correct root motion.

Resolution is uniform across the fleet. Every ground HERC lands on the same chain shape, and the parent links come from the `ANAnimList` relation pairs, the same table that places geometry ([`dts-node-posing.md`](../formats/dts-node-posing.md)):

| | camera part | transform | chain to root |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16 of 18 HERCs | 5 | 11 | 11 <- 4 <- 1 |
| MONGOOSE | 10 | 12 | 12 <- 11 <- 4 <- 1 |
| HEADHUNT | 5 | 12 | 12 <- 5 <- 1 |
| RAZOR | 12 | 1 | 1 (flyer, no animation) |

Node **1** is the one the walk, run, stop and turn sequences animate; 4 and 11 are the turret nodes sequences 0 and 5 drive (see [`torso-aim.md`](torso-aim.md)). The bob therefore comes entirely from node 1: with the turret held still, 4 and 11 contribute a fixed offset and no motion at all.

The chain also **rotates** only at 4 and 11. Measured over a full stride on OUTLAW, OGRE, MONGOOSE and HEADHUNT, the camera node's world orientation does not move — zero yaw, pitch and roll swing — so a walking machine's view bobs without tilting, and everything the pilot's frame is turned by comes from the turret. MONGOOSE's camera node carries a −570 (−3.1°) rest pitch of its own, so its view looks slightly down even with the turret centred.

On flat ground, standing eye height 3.2 m (STINGRAY) to 11.2 m (SAMSON), running 4.7 m to 11.8 m (OGRE), against the 6.1-10.4 m statures the manual's HERC specs quote. A stride swings the eye 0.24-0.42 m. Nothing here is fitted.

## Collision

`Mech_CollisionTest` (`00418f74`) answers "is the position I just integrated into refused", and is run after every move. Three things refuse it, in order:

1. **An object in the way.** The gap is asymmetric: **this** machine contributes its own vtable `+0x5c` and the **other** object its `+0x7c`, and an object whose `+0x7c` is zero is skipped before any distance is taken — see [`hit-detection.md`](hit-detection.md#the-three-radius-slots) for which classes those are. An object still waiting on its mission action is skipped as well.
2. **A structure's collision volume.** `Structure_GatherWalkCandidates` (`00404ae4`) walks the structure list at `DAT_004a9624` and hands `Structure_WalkCollisionTest` (`00427c68`) everything step 1 does not already cover: every static type, plus every animated type that has fallen to a wreck. It skips a structure that is *gone* — destroyed, no hulk, one component. `Structure_WalkCollisionTest` then tests the point against each one's `.DGS` height field (see [`hit-detection.md`](hit-detection.md#the-collision-volume--the-dgs-records-height-field)). Step 1 and step 2 are exact complements, so no structure is walked through and none is tested twice.
3. **Ground too steep**, `|normal.z| < 0x5aa` against normals scaled to the height grid's own one — about 45°. Off the grid counts as steep, which is what keeps a machine inside the zone. For the player only, a *downhill* refusal turns into a slide instead: the slope's X/Y accumulate at Q10 10 per tick, and the landing is [below](#the-landing).

A block against another **machine** also hurts both of them, through the explosive-damage slot — see [`damage-system.md`](damage-system.md#a-collision--mech_collisiontest-00418f74). It additionally latches "something ran into me" on the struck object (vtable `+0x68`, `obj+0xb1`), which only the ram behaviour reads.

### The structure a machine stands in

Separately from the block test, `Mech_CollisionTest` clears `mech+0x2b0` on entry and, for each candidate whose target class (`obj+0x1a8`) is 1 (a structure) and whose body radius contains the machine, stores that structure there (`00418fb2`, `00419016`). It is a render-side hand-off, not an aim or lock-on aid: `Scene_SubmitFrameObjects` reads it every frame (`00428519`) and, when it is set, submits the machine through `FUN_004283b4(mech, structure+0x1e8)` instead of the ordinary `FUN_0042837c(mech, GetBodyRadius())` — a machine standing inside a building's footprint is bucketed with the building rather than by its own radius.

### The landing

A slide that carried the machine more than `0xfa` (250) world units, measured as `Math_FastMagnitude2D` over the two accumulated axes, hurts on arrival:

```
base   = Q10Multiply(slideDamageScale[difficulty], distance)     // 0049a058: 400, 800, 1200, 1600
spread = base * 3
for component in 7..12:                                          // the six leg components
    vtable+0x74(component, RandomBelow(spread) + base, no attacker)
```

Every component is rolled separately over a window three times the base wide, so the six readings scatter rather than moving together. The write is the ordinary damage endpoint, so the landing cascades, can cripple or immobilise, and is stopped by the invulnerability setting like anything else ([`difficulty.md`](difficulty.md#the-two-sibling-cheats)). It carries no attacker, so nothing is credited if it kills.

It then calls `Cockpit_StartHitShake` (`00434010`), the same view shake and palette flash a hit on the cockpit raises ([`../formats/cockpit-canopy-palette.md`](../formats/cockpit-canopy-palette.md#the-damage-shake)), and `Sound_Play(0x29)`, the collision thump. This is the shake's ungated trigger: the direct-fire one tests who is flying and how far gone the cockpit is, and this one fires on any landing that got past the distance threshold.

## Open

- **Unported:** the structure record at `mech+0x2b0`, [above](#the-structure-a-machine-stands-in).
- **Open:** the gait state machine, about 60% of `Mech_LocomotionTick`'s body, is named here but its transitions — which sequence each speed change, stop and turn input selects, and the playback rate each one sets — are not written up.
