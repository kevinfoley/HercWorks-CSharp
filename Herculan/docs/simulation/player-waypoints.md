# Player waypoints and the nav marker

What the machine the player is flying does about its own route, and the second point the player can
put on the compass. The HUD gadget that draws both is
[`../formats/cockpit-hud.md`](../formats/cockpit-hud.md#waypoint-indicators); this doc owns the
simulation behind it.

**A player waypoint is the player group's mission route.** There is no separate record: the route is
the same block-3 waypoint group, resolved to block-1 points, that an AI group walks — see
[`ai-goals.md`](ai-goals.md#the-route-cursor-is-loaded-once) for the cursor and
[`../formats/msn-mission-file.md`](../formats/msn-mission-file.md) for the file layout. The player's
group holds it in `group+0x06` and its cursor in `group+0x04` like any other.

**Reaching one fires nothing.** Arrival posts a computer message and steps the cursor, and that is
all it does. A mission event is a block-5 action, and the only positional route to one is a block-4
*trigger area* — a box or a radius around a block-1 coordinate, tested against a subject's position
and nothing else (see
[`mission-deployment.md`](mission-deployment.md#the-four-ways-an-action-activates)). Authors put
those on the same coordinates their waypoints use, which is what makes arrival look like the trigger.

## The player's think — `Mech_BehaviourPlayerThink` (`0041c194`)

The think slot of behaviour states 1 `player` and 2 `player fly`
([`ai-dispatch.md`](ai-dispatch.md#the-22-states)). It decides nothing about movement — the player
steers — and always returns zero, so the state never ends itself. Everything in it is gated on the
machine being its group's leader, which for the player's own squad it always is.

```
if (mech != group.members[0]) return 0

next = Route_WaypointAt(group.cursor, group.cursor.index + 1)
if (next && Math_GroundDistanceBetweenPoints(mech.position, next) < 10000
         && !Route_NextWaypointClosesRoute(group.cursor)) {
    Computer_PostMessage(0x1d)                  // WAYPOINT REACHED
    Route_AdvanceCursor(group.cursor)
}
```

The arrival test is `Ai_DriveToPoint`'s exactly — 10000 units of ground range, 60 metres, measured
with Z dropped ([`ai-navigation.md`](ai-navigation.md#drive-to-a-point--ai_drivetopoint-0041fac4)).
Two things separate the player's arrival from an AI machine's:

- **It announces itself.** `SYSTEM.STR` message `0x1d`. No AI arrival posts anything.
- **It refuses a closed route's last leg.** `Route_NextWaypointClosesRoute` (`00423170`) answers yes
  when the waypoint ahead is both the route's last and the same point object as its first — the
  duplicate a patrol circuit closes on, and the one `Route_AdvanceCursor` would wrap straight off. So
  a circuit stops announcing at its last distinct waypoint instead of repeating waypoint 1 forever,
  and the cursor parks there.

**The cursor is shared with the group**, so the player's arrivals also drive `Group_IsOrderComplete`
for the squad's movement orders, and the squad's own `travelling` members can step it too.

### The three arms this doc does not cover

Past the waypoint arm the function switches on `DAT_004a9ed8`, a mission-objective selector, into
three more arms: an order target coming into range (`MISSION TARGET DETECTED`, `0x19`), closing
within 40000 of `Mech_AiGoalPosition`, and standing still inside 10000 of a data-link subject facing
it, which runs a four-message sequence on a timer (`ENGAGING DATA LINK` `0x34` through
`DATA TRANSFER COMPLETE` `0x37`, or `DATA TRANSFER ABORTED` `0x38` on breaking off). They belong to
the mission objective layer, which is not otherwise decoded. None of them touches the route.

## The nav marker

A point the player drops under their own feet and is steered back to. Three fields of the cockpit
view, and nothing else in the image reaches them:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `view+0x25e` | The marker's position, three ints copied wholesale from the machine's |
| `view+0x26a` | Set — a marker is down |
| `view+0x26b` | Armed — the player has since left 10000 units of it |

`NavMarker_DropAtPlayer` (`00434974`) drops one, replacing any already down and always leaving it
unarmed. `NavMarker_Tick` (`004349ac`) is the whole lifecycle and runs once a frame from the
cockpit's own paint (`FUN_004327ac`): leaving 10000 units arms the marker, and returning inside 10000
clears it and posts the same `0x1d` the route arm posts. A marker dropped where the player stands
therefore cannot clear on the frame it appeared. `NavMarker_Position` (`0043495c`) is the accessor
the HUD child reads, and answers null while the marker is not set.

**It is dropped by `[Alt+D]`** — command `0x220`, set-1 scancode `0x20` with the `0x200` the cockpit
adds for `[Alt]` ([`../formats/cockpit-input.md`](../formats/cockpit-input.md#keyboard-commands-are-scancodes)).
`CockpitWidgets_HandleCommand` claims that code in its own switch, so it never falls through to the
FlashComm panel, which is where the manual's `[Alt]`+hotkey documents `D` (DISENGAGE) going. The
manual does not mention the marker at all.

## Engine port

`MechObject.PlayerThink.cs` is the think, dispatched as `ThinkSlot.Player` from `MechObject.AiTick`;
`MissionGroup.NextWaypointClosesRoute` is the refusal test; `Content.NavMarker` is the marker, held
by the host beside the mission clock because it is cockpit-view state rather than the machine's.
`Content.WaypointMark` resolves either subject to the bearing, range and number the HUD draws.

The three objective arms are not ported, and neither is `DAT_004a9ed8` that selects them.

## Rejected readings

| Reading | Why it is wrong |
|---|---|
| The player's waypoints are their own mission record, separate from the AI's routes | They are order slot 0's route on the player's own group, read through the same `Route_WaypointAt` the AI uses |
| Reaching a waypoint fires the mission action attached to it | A waypoint carries no action ref. What fires is a block-4 trigger area the author has put on the same coordinate |
| The waypoint indicator can point at the player's selected target instead of the route | The branch exists, gated on `DAT_004d2af0`. That global has exactly one reference in the image — the read that tests it. Its two `.bss` neighbours `DAT_004d2aec` and `DAT_004d2af4` are each written by name, so the region is individually addressed and nothing is reaching it through a base-plus-offset either: it is zero for the whole run and the branch is unreachable |
| `Ai_FollowRoute` is the only thing that advances a route cursor | It is one of four callers of `Route_AdvanceCursor`. The others are this think, `Flyer_LeadRouteStep` ([`ai-flyers.md`](ai-flyers.md)) and `FUN_0046a8e4`, the route half of an undecoded class' movement tick at `0046a70c` |
