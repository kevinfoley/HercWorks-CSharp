# Preferences and controls (DBSIM.EXE)

The two panels [F12] reaches, and the file they edit. Both are members of the modal alert-panel
family whose shared base, paint conventions and button widget are in
[`mission-objectives.md`](mission-objectives.md#the-status-alert--gnl_alrt-00455934); this doc owns
only what is particular to them.

`PreferencesPanel_Raise` (`0045cfd4`) is what commands `0x58` ([F12]) and `0x219` ([Alt+P]) reach
([`../formats/cockpit-input.md`](../formats/cockpit-input.md#keyboard-commands-are-scancodes)). It
raises `DAT_004d2576` to stop the simulation for as long as the panel is up, snapshots the view
object's whole settings block beforehand and writes it back on the way out. The CONTROLS button then
builds the second panel over the first, which stays on screen behind it.

## `data\prefs.cfg` — the option array

**The file is the array.** `Prefs_LoadOptions` (`00459754`) memsets `SimOptions` (`004d1fbc`) to zero
for `0x36` bytes and reads the file straight over it with no parse at all, so **an option's index is
its byte offset** and a retail `prefs.cfg` is 54 bytes.

Three functions write it, all through `Prefs_SetOption` (`0045993c`), which saves the outgoing byte
to the shadow array at `004d2028`, stores the new one, and — when told to apply — calls that option's
handler from the parallel table at `004d2060`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `Prefs_ToggleOption` (`00459980`) | `value ^ 1` |
| `Prefs_StepOption` (`004599b8`) | `value + 1`, wrapping to 0 at the caller's modulus |
| `Prefs_StepOptionBack` (`004599f4`) | `value - 1`, wrapping to `modulus - 1` below zero |

The caller supplies the modulus, which is why one pair drives a three-value row and a five-value one.

`Prefs_Init` (`0045a19c`) registers the handler table and loads the file. **Five options have a
handler and the other 49 have none**, so most settings are read where they are used rather than
pushed anywhere: 0, 1 and 2 take `00459c98`, `00459c6c` and `00459cc4`, 8 takes `00459d4c`, and
**`0x0e` takes `Input_SetThrottleLeverMode`** — which is the herc controls block's THROTTLE row, and
so an independent corroboration of where that block starts.

### Writing it back — `Prefs_SaveSelectedOptions` (`00459b78`)

**Every save is a read-modify-write of named options, never a dump of the array.** The function
re-reads the current 54 bytes off disk into a local buffer, copies just the options its
`(count, short *indices)` argument names out of `SimOptions` over that buffer, and writes the buffer
back. An option it does not name keeps whatever is on disk rather than whatever is in memory.

`Prefs_SaveAllOptions` (`0045981c`) is the dump — open the path, write all `0x36` bytes, close — and
nothing calls it. It has no references of any kind.

Four callers, and between them they are every write the simulator makes:

| Caller | Saves | When |
|---|---|---|
| `PreferencesPanel_Save` (`004574cc`) | 9: options 0-3 and 7-11 (`DAT_0049e304`) | `PreferencesPanel_Run` closing the panel |
| `ControlsPanel_Save` (`00459140`) | 13: `ControlsOptionBase - 1` through `+11` | `ControlsPanel_Run` closing the panel, at `00458c07` |
| `Joystick_InitAndSeedBindings` (`00459dd4`) | 25: options 12-36 (`DAT_0049e9d0`) — both blocks | First run only, gated on `DAT_004d1fc8` |
| `Prefs_SaveOption` (`00459b64`) | 1 | MAIN at `0045f413`, on option 6, at every launch |

**There is no cancel.** `PreferencesPanel_Revert` (`004574e0`) tests the same nine options with
`Prefs_OptionChanged` (`00459c38`) and rolls the changed ones back out of the load-time shadow at
`004d1ff2` through `Prefs_RevertSelectedOptions` (`00459b04`) — and it is unreferenced, as
`Prefs_SaveAllOptions` is. Leaving the preferences panel saves, whichever button does it.

The controls panel pairs its save with `Prefs_CommitOptions` (`00459878`) one instruction later,
which walks all 54 options, calls the handler of each one that differs from the load-time shadow, and
re-baselines both shadows. That is the apply step the panels otherwise lack.

**The controls panel's index list is latched.** `ControlsPanel_Save` builds it from
`ControlsOptionBase` the first time it runs and sets `DAT_0049e7fc`, so the list keeps whatever base
that was. Within one run of the simulator the player's machine is fixed by the mission load, so the
latch has nothing to go stale against. It also means the `- 1` entry is option 12, the
joystick-configured flag, only for a walker; flying a RAZOR it is option 24, the walker's last button
binding, which is rewritten with its own unchanged value.

### What each byte is

| Option | Row | Values |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | MUSIC | off / on |
| 1 | SOUNDS | off / on |
| 2 | PILOT MESSAGE | 0 text only, 1 voice only, 2 both |
| 3 | COMPUTER MESSAGE | as option 2 |
| 7 | TERRAIN DISTANCE | 0-2, the draw radius ([`../formats/terrain-texturing.md`](../formats/terrain-texturing.md#the-terrain-detail-setting)) |
| 8 | TERRAIN TEXTURE | off / on |
| 9 | HERC DETAIL | 0-4 |
| 10 | STRUCTURE DETAIL | 0-2 |
| 11 | EFFECTS DETAIL | 0-2, and `Sound_DetailSetting` ([`../formats/audio.md`](../formats/audio.md)) |
| 13-24 | the controls panel's twelve, walking a HERC | [below](#the-bindings-are-twelve-bytes-of-the-same-file) |
| 25-36 | the same twelve, flying the RAZOR | |

`ControlsOptionBase` (`004d25fb`) selects between the last two blocks: `Sim_InitMissionSession`
(`004614fc`) sets it to `0x19` when `PilotingRazor` (`004d25f5`) is set and `0x0d` otherwise, and
`PreferencesManager_Reset` (`0045cad8`) starts it on `0x0d`. **The two blocks are independent** — a
binding made in a walker does not disturb the RAZOR's.

Options 4-6, 12 and 37-53 are not identified. Neither panel reads them.

## The preferences panel — `prf_alrt` (`004566c4`)

Nine settings and two plain buttons, as a strip along the bottom of the screen with the frozen
cockpit above it. It is the one member of the family that **does not centre**: its constructor calls
`AlertPanel_SetRect` with an origin outright where the other three go through
`AlertPanel_CenterRect`.

### Its text

`str\PRF_ALRT.STR`, five groups read in file order:

| Group | Holds |
|---|---|
| 0 | `PREFERENCES` |
| 1 | the eleven button captions, in widget order |
| 2 | `OFF`, `ON` |
| 3 | `TEXT ONLY`, `VOICE ONLY`, `TEXT / VOICE` |
| 4 | `LOW`, `MED LOW`, `MED HIGH`, `HIGH`, `MAXIMUM` |

`hba\PRF_ALRT.HBA` frame 0 is the 630x170 plate, with the group boxes and a black well behind every
readout painted into it. Frames 1-4 are the 133x22 button in four border colours; all eleven buttons
use them.

### Geometry

The constructor writes the block into `.bss` once as `value << VideoMode_?CoordShift`, so every
number is an authored 320-wide coordinate doubled. Rects are panel-local.

| Global | Device | Is |
|---|---|---|
| `004d1f64`/`66` | 638 x 178 | the declared size. The plate is 630 wide, so eight columns at the right end are empty |
| `004d1f68`/`6a` | (0, 300) | the screen origin, given rather than derived |
| `004d1f6e`/`70` | y 0, height 16 | the title bar |
| `004d1f7a`/`7c` | (4, 0) | the readouts' label margin |
| `004d1f6c`, `72` | 0 | title margins |

Nine parallel `short[]` tables carry the rects — `0049e224` onwards for the eleven buttons' x, y,
width, height and first plate frame, `0049e292` onwards for the nine readouts' x, y, width and
height. Every width and height entry repeats one value: buttons are 132x18 (art 133x22, blitted at
the rect origin so it overhangs) and readouts 126x14. The layout is two columns of five and four
rows at x 18 and 312, the readouts three pixels past their button, and CONTROLS and DONE at
(312, 142) and (450, 142).

### What a row reads — `PreferencesPanel_RefreshRow` (`004571f4`)

Nine cases, one per row, each setting one readout's label. Rows 0-3 and 5 index their string group
with the option byte directly; the four detail rows index group 4 through a five-entry `short[]` map
of their own:

| Row | Option | Group | Map |
|---|---|---|---|
| MUSIC, SOUNDS | 0, 1 | 2 | direct |
| PILOT MESSAGE, COMPUTER MESSAGE | 2, 3 | 3 | direct |
| TERRAIN DISTANCE | 7 | 4 | `0049e2da` = {0, 2, 4, 0, 0} |
| TERRAIN TEXTURE | 8 | 2 | direct |
| HERC DETAIL | 9 | 4 | `0049e2e4` = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} |
| STRUCTURE DETAIL | 10 | 4 | `0049e2ee` = {0, 2, 4, 0, 0} |
| EFFECTS DETAIL | 11 | 4 | `0049e2f8` = {0, 2, 4, 0, 0} |

The three `{0, 2, 4, 0, 0}` maps are why a three-setting row reads `LOW` / `MED HIGH` / `MAXIMUM` and
skips the two intermediate words. **All four maps are five entries wide** — they sit 10 bytes apart —
so a map is not itself evidence of how many settings its row has; what bounds a row is the modulus
its click case passes.

### What a click does — `PreferencesPanel_Run` (`00456d4c`)

The click handler (`004573a8`) records the widget index and, for the nine option rows, moves the
highlight: the row that had it goes back to widget state 3 and the clicked one to state 0. The loop
then acts on the index, and **three different rules are in play**:

| Rows | Rule |
|---|---|
| MUSIC, SOUNDS, TERRAIN TEXTURE | toggle |
| TERRAIN DISTANCE, HERC DETAIL | step forward on a left click, back on a right one |
| STRUCTURE DETAIL, EFFECTS DETAIL | step **forward on either button** — see [Rejected readings](#rejected-readings) |
| PILOT MESSAGE, COMPUTER MESSAGE | step forward only, and only while `VoiceArchivePresent` is set |

`VoiceArchivePresent` (`0049e9cd`) is set once by `Voice_ArchiveExists` (`00459d6c`), which builds
the localised `simvoice` name and simply tries to `fopen` it. When it is clear, `Prefs_Init` forces
options 2 and 3 to 0 and neither row can be clicked off it, so the player cannot ask for voice the
install does not carry.

**With no sound device the first four rows are greyed** — the loop puts widgets 0-3 into state 2
before it starts, on `SfxManager` being null. `Widget_HitTestChildren` skips a state-2 widget, so
they are not merely inert but invisible to the hit test.

CONTROLS builds the controls panel and runs it inline; DONE calls `FUN_004574cc` and closes.

## The controls panel — `ctl_alrt` (`00457d1c`)

Four joystick axis assignments and one action per joystick button, with the action list of the
selected button beside them. 370x372, centred, over whatever is already on screen.

### It is two panels in one file

`str\CTL_ALRT.STR` carries thirteen groups and the constructor reads eight — title, the fourteen
captions, the twenty-one action names, the OPTIONS caption, then a three-word set per axis row. When
`PilotingRazor` (`004d25f5`) is set it reads **five more** and overwrites the title and all four axis
sets with them:

| Group | Walking | Flying |
|---|---|---|
| title | 0 `HERC CONTROLS` | 8 `RAZOR CONTROLS` |
| JOYSTICK | 4: `NO JOYSTICK`, `MOVEMENT`, `TURRET` | 9: `NO JOYSTICK`, `PITCH / ROLL`, `THROTTLE / YAW` |
| THROTTLE | 5: `NO THROTTLE`, `THROTTLE`, `TURRET ELEVATION` | 10: `NO THROTTLE`, `PITCH`, `THROTTLE` |
| RUDDER | 6: `NO RUDDER`, `DIRECTION`, `TURRET ROTATION` | 11: `NO RUDDER`, `ROLL`, `YAW` |
| HAT | 7: `NO HAT`, `VIEWS`, `TURRET` | 12: `NO HAT`, `VIEWS`, `THROTTLE / YAW` |

Group 1 is the fourteen captions (JOYSTICK, THROTTLE, RUDDER, HAT, BUTTON 1-8, RECOMMEND, DONE),
group 2 the twenty-one action names indexed by action code, and group 3 the `OPTIONS` caption.

`DAT_004d25f5` is written in one place: `DBSim_LoadScriptDat` sets it from
`playerMechType == 8`, the RAZOR.

### Geometry

Same shape as the preferences panel's block, at `004d1fa8`: 370 x 372, title bar y 0 height 16, label
margin (4, 0). `AlertPanel_CenterRect` puts it at (135, 54) on the 640x480 screen. The constructor
takes an optional screen origin instead, and every reachable call site passes none.

Ten parallel `short[]` tables: `0049e510` onwards for the fourteen buttons' x, y, width, height,
first plate frame and caption margin, `0049e5b8` onwards for the twelve readouts' x, y, width and
height. `0049e618` is the write-once flag guarding the `.bss` block.

**Three button sizes, each with its own four-frame set** in `hba\CTL_ALRT.HBA` (frame 0 is the
372x374 plate): the four axis rows are 136x18 on frames 5-8, the eight button rows 68x18 on frames
1-4, and RECOMMEND and DONE 90x18 on frames 9-12. A button draws `base + state`, and **the three sets
do not order their four colours alike** — 1-4 and 5-8 run rest, held, disabled, option, while 9-12
run option, rest, held, disabled. That is a property of the art; the paint indexes all three the
same way.

The OPTIONS list sits at x 226-354: its caption at y 138 height 10, then twelve rows at pitch 14
starting a **whole pitch below** the caption, the constructor advancing its running rect before each
`Label_SetRect` rather than after. The caption is the one label on the panel given no background
colour, which is why its rect can overlap the border the plate paints across that band without
erasing it.

### The capability block

What the panel greys its rows against is `Input_QueryCapabilities`' eight bytes, whose fields the
input layer owns —
[`../formats/joystick-input.md`](../formats/joystick-input.md#the-capability-block--input_querycapabilities-004777f8).

The panel reaches it in two steps. `FUN_0045c508(3)` is asked first, and when it answers null or with
its low bit clear the panel takes **no block at all** and greys all twelve rows at once — which is
what a stick the retail code cannot enumerate produces. Only past that gate does it read the fields
and grey rows one at a time: `+2` bounds the button rows, `+4`, `+5` and `+6` gate THROTTLE, RUDDER
and HAT. The JOYSTICK row has no field of its own: once a stick is present it is always live.

`ControlsPanel_RefreshRow` (`00458d20`) gates every one of its twelve cases on the same capability
and **sets no text at all** when it fails, so a greyed row reads blank rather than showing a stale
binding.

### The bindings are twelve bytes of the same file

At `ControlsOptionBase` + 0..11. An axis row's byte indexes its three-word set directly; a button
row's byte is an action code into the twenty-one names, also directly. What the input layer then
does with them — which game axes a row's 0, 1 and 2 select, and what each action code dispatches —
is [`../formats/joystick-input.md`](../formats/joystick-input.md#applying-the-bindings--fun_0045a7f4).

Which actions a button row may be **bound to** is a separate table, read by `ControlsPanel_ActionAt`
(`00457cdc`): eight rows of thirteen bytes at `0049e619` walking and `0049e681` flying. **Code 0
terminates a row rather than meaning OFF** — the constructor counts a row's length by walking until
it reads a zero — so although `OFF` is action name 0 it is never an offered choice, only what a row
displays when its stored byte is 0. BUTTON 1 is the extreme case: one entry, `FIRE`, so the trigger
cannot be rebound. The other seven rows carry twelve actions each and **alternate between two lists**,
one holding `NEXT WEAPON` and the other `PREV WEAPON`.

### What a click does — `ControlsPanel_Run` (`00458650`)

The click handler (`00458ebc`) moves the highlight the same way the preferences panel's does, then
decides between selecting and acting: a button row is *selected* only when it is not already the
selected one, and otherwise its action is queued. **So a button row takes two clicks to change** —
the first points the OPTIONS list at it, the second and later ones step it. An axis row is never
selected, so every click on one steps it and clears the list selection.

| Widget | Action |
|---|---|
| 0-3 | step that axis's option over its three words, forward on a left click and back on a right one; clear the list selection |
| 4-11 | select, or step that button row |
| 12 | RECOMMEND |
| 13 | DONE — closes the panel |

A button row steps by **slot index within its own list** (`panel+0x462`, wrapping at that row's
length in `panel+0x46a`), not by action code: `ControlsPanel_StepButton` (`00459320`) forward and
`ControlsPanel_StepButtonBack` (`0045938c`) back both advance the slot and then write out whatever
code that slot holds. The slot is seeded at construction by searching the row's list for the stored code, and
left at 0 when it is not there — so a row showing a code its own list does not offer starts stepping
from the top rather than from what it shows.

`ControlsPanel_FillOptionList` (`004593f8`) refills the twelve OPTIONS labels from the selected row's
list, writing an empty string for every row when nothing is selected and past the end of the list
otherwise. A freshly raised panel has none selected, so the box starts blank.

### RECOMMEND

`Input_RecommendedBindings` (`0045a258`) returns a twelve-byte block — four axis modes then eight
action codes — and case 13 pushes every byte through `Prefs_SetOption`:

| | Axes | Buttons |
|---|---|---|
| Walking | 1, 0, 2, 2 | `FIRE`, `TARGET`, `CENTER TURRET`, `ATT TOGGLE`, `NEXT CHAIN`, `NEXT WEAPON`, `SHIELDS FRONT`, `SHIELDS REAR` |
| Flying | 1, 0, 2, 2 | `FIRE`, `TARGET`, `LINK WEAPON`, `MFD DISPLAYS`, `NEXT CHAIN`, `NEXT WEAPON`, `SHIELDS FRONT`, `SHIELDS REAR` |

The eight button bytes take a detour: the code searches the row's list for the recommended code,
stores the slot it found — **0 when it is not there** — and writes back whatever code *that slot*
holds. See [Rejected readings](#rejected-readings) for what that costs.

That function also carries an arm that zeroes the block, taken when the capability block's `+0` is 0.
`Input_QueryCapabilities` writes 1 or 2 into that field unconditionally and is the only thing that
fills the block, so the arm cannot be reached through its own input. With no stick the panel greys
its twelve rows but leaves RECOMMEND live, so pressing it still writes this set; the readouts stay
blank because the refresh is gated on the same missing capabilities.

## Engine port

`Content.SimulatorPreferences` is the file and the three write primitives. `Content.PreferencesPanel`
and `Content.ControlsPanel` hold each panel's text, its state and its click rules;
`Content.PreferencesPanelLayout` and `Content.ControlsPanelLayout` hold the geometry tables above,
over the same `Content.AlertPanelLayout` the other two panels use, which gained an uncentred
placement for the preferences strip and the `INACTIVE` caption font for a greyed row.
`Content.JoystickCapabilities` is the capability block. `Render.Overlay2DRenderer.DrawPreferencesPanel`
and `DrawControlsPanel` paint them through the shared `DrawAlertPanel`, which carries a per-button
bank, frame and font and a per-label alignment for these two. Both plates are packed into the
cockpit's sprite atlas with the rest. `Terrain.TerrainDetail` reads its setting through
`SimulatorPreferences` rather than parsing the file itself. What reads the twelve binding bytes at
run time is `Input.JoystickBindings` —
[`../formats/joystick-input.md`](../formats/joystick-input.md#engine-port).

Divergences:

- **A changed setting is not applied while the panel is up.** `SimulatorPreferences.Set` models the
  store half of `Prefs_SetOption` and neither of the other two: the shadow copy at `004d2028` is a
  revert path and the handler table at `004d2060` an apply path. So the five options with a handler
  do not take effect until something reads them again. The controls block is the exception, being
  read fresh every tick by the input layer, so a rebinding is live on the next frame.
- **`--no-write-prefs` can turn saving off**, which the original has no equivalent of. Saving itself
  is the original's: each panel merges its own options into a fresh read of the file as it closes,
  and a file the engine did not read is never written.
- **The panels are placed against the window**, as the other two are.
- **The RAZOR half is selected by the player's chassis id**, resolved through `HercLUT`, where the
  original reads the global the mission load wrote.
