# DBSIM.EXE reactor and Master Energy Pool

The reactor and the pool are separate things: the reactor is a **rate** (`mech+0x256`), the pool is a **capacitor** (`mech+0x292`). Consumers draw on the pool, never on the reactor.

## The per-tick cycle — `Mech_PerTickSystemsUpdate` (`0041aa5c`)

Called once per live mech per tick from `Sim_MainTick` (`0045f464`). Its first five statements are the whole power model:

```
pool += IntegrateRateOverTick(reactorRate)      // ADD word ptr [EBX+0x292],AX
budget = pool - 500                             // ADD DX,0xfe0c
budget = weaponMountManager->vtable[0](budget, mech)
budget = Shield_RechargeTick(mech+0x222, budget)
pool   = budget + 500                           // overwrite, not subtract
pool   = clamp(pool, 0, 10000)
```

Consumption is not a subtraction: the pool is **rebuilt** each tick from whatever survives the pass.

- **Reserve = 500.** Held out of every arbitration, so a machine under sustained load settles at 500 rather than 0. Below it the budget goes negative, which energy mounts read as "give charge back".
- **Ceiling = 10000**, also the value `Mech_Constructor` writes at spawn — a HERC powers up full.
- **Order is weapons, then shields.** The manual's "movement, shields, and weapons, in that order" is wrong on both count and order; locomotion never reads the pool. The consequence it describes is real: shields only ever get what the weapons leave.

## Reactor output rate — `Mech_ComputeReactorRate` (`00417d08`)

```
rate = 20                                  // MOV ESI,0x14 — a literal
if   (mech+0xab) rate = Q10(200, 20)  = 3  // reactor critical
elif (mech+0xaa) rate = Q10(600, 20)  = 11 // reactor degraded
if (EnergyPod)
    rate += Q10(podCurve(podDamage), 20)   // up to +20; nothing past the curve's cutoff
```

`podCurve` is the damage curve every pod bonus shares, owned by [`equipment-pods.md`](equipment-pods.md#the-damage-curve-both-bonuses-share). The pod is `mech+0x313`, slot 3 of the array [`equipment-pods.md`](equipment-pods.md) describes.

**Base rate is uniform across the fleet.** The function never reads the mech type record. At the 25 Hz tick `IntegrateRateOverTick(20)` yields 6 pool units/tick, i.e. 150/s.

**The Energy Pod doubles the recharge rate, not the pool's capacity.** The manual says capacity. A pristine pod adds the full 20 to the base 20, while the ceiling is the literal 10000 in both `Mech_Constructor` and the clamp, so nothing can raise it. The manual's own aside, a modest increase in the Pool recharge rate, describes what the code does.

**Computed once, at spawn.** `Mech_ComputeReactorRate` has exactly one reference in the binary — the tail of `Mech_ConfigureLoadout` (`004175dc`), itself only reached on spawn. Damage taken mid-mission never changes the rate; the damage terms still matter because a machine can spawn already damaged.

Its sibling `Mech_ComputeShieldCapacity` (`00417bec`) is **not** like this: `Mech_ComponentDamageWrite` (`00417de4`) calls it as well as the spawn path, so shield capacity really does shrink as the generator is shot.

### Reactor damage flags

`Mech_ComponentDamageWrite` (`00417de4`) latches them off dependent-subpiece **5**'s damage:

| Subpiece 5 damage | Flag | Reactor output | Also |
|---|---|---|---|
| ≤ 50% (`0x80`) | — | 20 | — |
| > 50%, < 75% (`0xc1`) | `mech+0xaa` | 11 (~59%) | movement penalty; alert sound for the player |
| ≥ 75% | `mech+0xab` | 3 (~20%) | movement penalty; alert sound |

Identified as the reactor by effect: the same pair cuts power and mobility together. Both latch and are never cleared, and the check is gated on **both** being clear — so once `+0xaa` sets, `+0xab` is only reachable by a single hit crossing both thresholds at once.

## Weapon energy arbitration — `WeaponMounts_ArbitrateEnergy` (`004107e4`)

Vtable slot 0 of the mount-manager object at `mech+0x202`, for both the local (`00499238`) and remote (`00499338`) manager classes. The mounts it serves are in [`weapon-mounts.md`](weapon-mounts.md).

- Mounts are served one at a time, highest priority first. Priority is the mount's `+0x7b`, except a mount already mid-charge (`+0x43`) reports 10000 and jumps the queue.
- The player's selected mount (`manager+0x1d`) is served before the ranking is consulted; the AI passes `-1` and goes straight to the ranking.
- Per mount, `WeaponMount_ChargeCapacitor` (`0040f00c`) takes `min(chargeRate +0x7f, budget, capacitor deficit)` into `+0x7d` and passes the remainder on.
- Once any mount reports itself mid-charge, every mount after it targets zero instead and **bleeds its capacitor back into the pool** at 5/tick. One energy weapon charges at a time.
- Ammunition mounts consume nothing — their slot-`0x34` override returns the budget untouched.
- The equipment pods are mounts too and take the same turn. Every pod but one inherits the refire-timer turn and returns the budget untouched; the **Turbo Pod** is the only pod that draws on the pool, buying its charge back out of what the guns left, so it competes with the weapons for the same budget and a machine firing hard refills it slowly. The spend, the `min(20, budget, 2000 - charge)` buy-back and the rest of the pod are in [`equipment-pods.md`](equipment-pods.md#what-each-class-actually-overrides).
- PLAS (id 25) is half-efficiency: its deficit counts double and only half of what it draws is stored.
- The **unlimited energy and ammunition** setting refunds the whole pass's consumption, player only (`DAT_004a9ed6 == 0 && DAT_004a9edc == 1`): the mounts are served and charged as they otherwise would be, and the budget handed back to the pool is the one the pass was called with. Both globals are `script.dat` header fields and the practice missions screen is what sets them — see [`difficulty.md`](difficulty.md#the-two-sibling-cheats).

An idle machine draws nothing: every energy mount powers up with `+0x7d` already at `+0x7b`, so the deficit is zero until a shot is demanded.

## Cockpit readouts

The pool's one cockpit readout is the **Master Energy Pool meter**: `Player_PerFrameCockpitUpdate` (`0041b130`) computes `(pool << 10) / 10000` and pushes it to the LED bar at cockpit slot `+0x1e5`, whose range is `0x400` — see [`cockpit-hud-widgets.md`](../formats/cockpit-hud-widgets.md#led-gauges). The shield rings and numbers show the shield array, not the pool ([`cockpit-hud-widgets.md`](../formats/cockpit-hud-widgets.md#shieldsgauge)), and a weapon's charge bar shows its own capacitor ([`weapon-mounts.md`](weapon-mounts.md#energy)).

## Shield refill time

The recharge cap is per *tick*, not per unit time, but the tick is held to 25 Hz ([`dbsim-physics-notes.md`](dbsim-physics-notes.md#fixed-point-math-toolkit)), so the refill time of 28 s from empty ([`damage-system.md`](damage-system.md#recharge-tick--shield_rechargetick-00413b38)) does not vary with hardware. Retail takes about 30 s, matching.

At mission start the shield rings fade in black to green. That is the power-up animation, not charge: both facings are full from `Shield_Init` onward ([`cockpit-hud-widgets.md`](../formats/cockpit-hud-widgets.md#shield-rings-fill)).
