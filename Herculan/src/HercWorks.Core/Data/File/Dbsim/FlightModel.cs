/// <para>The names here are the roles that function gives each field. The obvious reading of the

/// which the field order invites — is wrong: only three concern roll at all, and the two that look
/// most like roll constants are general. <see cref="AngularDamping"/> damps every axis, and
/// <see cref="LateralDrag"/> is sideslip drag, applied to velocity rather than to rotation.</para>

/// anything flies, which is what makes the flight ceiling rise with airspeed. It is a derived
/// figure rather than file content, so it is not a field of this type — see the engine's
