/// FILE - /SIMVOL0/RMP/ worldX.rmp — the theater's colour ramp, paired 1:1 by name with the
/// corresponding worldX.wld (see <see cref="WorldData"/>). Every flat-shaded face in DBSIM passes
/// its colour through this table before it reaches the framebuffer.
///   0 - INT32 - <see cref="ShadeLevels"/>, 32 in every retail file.
///   4 - INT32 - <see cref="DepthSlices"/>, 12 in every retail file.
///   8.. - <see cref="Rows"/>, DepthSlices * ShadeLevels rows of <see cref="RowLength"/> bytes
///     (98304 in every retail file, which is the whole of the rest).
///
/// <para>A row is 256 palette bytes — "this colour, at this brightness, at this distance" — so the
/// file is one colour ramp per palette index, sampled 32 ways for light and 12 ways for distance.
/// Hue is preserved throughout, which is what makes it a ramp rather than a remap. The consumer is
/// <c>FUN_00468054</c>, whose whole body is the address arithmetic
/// <c>row = ((shade * (shadeLevels - 1) + depthBias) &amp; ~0xFF) + rampBase</c>, with
/// <c>depthBias</c> a whole number of 8192-byte depth slices set from the drawn object's range.
/// That is the original's distance fog. See docs/simulation/distance-fog-and-sky.md.</para>
///
/// <para><b>This class previously described the body as an undecoded per-world blob, "likely a
/// 256-wide x 384-tall grid, possibly a heightmap".</b> The grid hypothesis was arithmetically
/// right and semantically wrong: the 256-byte period a continuity check found is the row length,
/// and 384 rows is 12 slices x 32 shades, both of which the header states outright. It is a shade
/// table, not terrain.</para>
