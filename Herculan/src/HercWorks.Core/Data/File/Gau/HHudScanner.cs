/// into the widget at <c>+0x10b</c>/<c>+0x10f</c>, right after the four rects
/// <see cref="HGunsightArea"/> covers.
///
/// Like <see cref="HReticle"/> this is a bare (X,Y) point rather than a corner rect —
/// <see cref="WidgetBase.Size"/> is unused. The repeater's extent is not in the file: its paint
/// (<c>HudScanner_Paint</c>, <c>0043f2b0</c>) squares off <c>0x2e</c> units from this point on both axes.

/// Position varies per herc; see docs/formats/mfd-scanner.md, "Geometry".

/// Read out of <see cref="GAUFile.Remainder"/>, which is still what the write path emits.
