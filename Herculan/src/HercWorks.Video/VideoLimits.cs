/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>A frame's dimensions come from the stream, and every codec multiplies them out to size a
/// buffer. Unbounded, a four-byte field asks for a 16-exabyte allocation.</item>
/// <item>RIFF chunks nest, and a <c>LIST</c> may contain a <c>LIST</c>. Unbounded, a file that
/// nests a few thousand deep overflows the parse stack before any length check runs.</item>
/// <item>Indeo 3 splits a plane by recursive binary subdivision, with the split codes coming from
/// the bitstream. Unbounded, a stream of nothing but split codes recurses without limit.</item>
/// <item>Run-length opcodes in MS-RLE, MS Video 1 and Indeo 3 all advance a write cursor by a
/// count read from the stream. Bounding the cursor stops a malformed run writing past its row;
/// bounding the opcode count stops a run that never terminates.</item>
