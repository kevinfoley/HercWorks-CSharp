/// The modern half of joystick support: finds a device through Silk.NET, reads it every frame and
/// hands the result to <see cref="JoystickDeviceMap"/>, which flattens it into the abstract
/// four-axis, one-hat, eight-button shape the retail bindings are written against.
///
/// <para>This is where <c>joyGetDevCapsA</c>/<c>joyGetPosEx</c> used to be — <c>Joystick_Enumerate</c>
/// (<c>00477568</c>) and <c>Joystick_Poll</c> (<c>00477614</c>). Nothing above this class knows the
/// difference: the capability block it produces has the same five fields the original's does, and the
/// bindings that consume it are the same twelve bytes of <c>prefs.cfg</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Silk.NET reports axes positionally, and that is the layer's one real limitation.</b> GLFW
/// hands over an ordered array of floats with no HID usages attached, so nothing here can tell a
/// throttle from a twist grip — the order is whatever the driver enumerated, and on a HOTAS those two
/// commonly come out swapped against the 1996 convention the retail format assumes. There is no
/// automatic answer to that: HID has no "throttle" usage, so no API reports one. The device map is
/// where a player says which is which; <c>--joystick-probe</c> is how they find out.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Two GLFW behaviours shape the rest.</b> It publishes a fixed sixteen joystick slots and
/// leaves the unused ones reporting <see cref="IJoystick.IsConnected"/> false, so a device has to be
/// picked by connectedness and not by index. And a connected device reports <b>zero</b> axes, buttons
/// and hats until the first <c>Update</c> — the counts arrive a frame after <c>CreateInput</c>. So the
/// map is derived lazily, from whatever the device is reporting now, and re-derived whenever that
/// changes; deriving one at load time maps nothing at all.</para>
