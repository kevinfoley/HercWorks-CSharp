	// aspect ratio fit to the full window height — not an equal three-way split of the window — so the
	// quads butt together edge-to-edge with no seam or overlap regardless of how the front and side art's
	// proportions differ from each other. The resulting three-panel composite is anchored to the window's
	// horizontal center as one unit: a narrower window crops its outer edges symmetrically, a wider one
	// leaves equal empty margins, and no panel is ever stretched.
	//
	// The 3D scene behind the three panels is one camera over one viewport, CockpitScreenLayout.World:
	// retail's glances are the forward view's image plane continued sideways, not turned cameras, so the

	// viewport and differs only in the scissor it is drawn under.

	// is a canvas twice the screen's height with the forward view's art at canvas row 0 and the HDD's at
	// row 474, both blitted during mission bring-up, and switching between them is a scroll of the
	// display window over that canvas — never a redraw (see CockpitViewGeometry, and CockpitPan for the
	// transition's own machinery). This reproduces the same geometry with two quads at fixed canvas
	// offsets and a moving window: the three cockpit panels are offset up by the pan distance, the HDD
	// panel sits one travel-distance below them, and the 3D viewports ride along with their panels so
	// the world scrolls out of frame exactly as the art does. The two views' art overlaps by six rows on
