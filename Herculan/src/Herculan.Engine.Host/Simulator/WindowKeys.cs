	/// The simulator's two full-screen key paths. [Alt+Enter] is command 0x21c, which Sim_DispatchCommand
	/// offers Sim_HandleWindowKey (0045fd60) after the widget tree, so it comes through the dispatcher's
	/// own input — a replaying tape's keys during a replay. During a replay Input_BuildPlayerDevice also
	/// offers Sim_HandleWindowKey the live keyboard's command, so the player's own [Alt+Enter] works too.
	/// Retail's -B stops a replay toggling; this host has no -B. [Alt+Enter] also toggles here while a modal
	/// panel (the pause panel among them) holds the input, which is this engine's choice, made without
	/// settling whether retail's panel loops reach the dispatcher for it; the panels ignore an [Enter] with
	/// [Alt] held (ModalPanels.PanelKey), so the toggle never also presses a panel button. The other path
	/// is Key_WndProcHook (00477ae0), which hands 0x20f [Alt+Tab], 0x201 [Alt+Esc] and 0x401 [Ctrl+Esc] to
	/// Video_LeaveFullscreen (004668b0) before anything else sees a key, so those read the live keyboard
	/// always. [Alt+Tab] is left out here at the user's request, so switching away keeps the window full
	/// screen behind the one switched to, as a modern game's does (EngineWindow.ToggleFullScreen). The hook
	/// matches them before SimCommandMask strips [Shift], so with [Shift] held they are other codes;
	/// [Alt+Enter] goes through the mask, so [Shift] does not matter to it. Both act on the key going down,
	/// as the hook passes a key-down message on and marks a key-up one.
