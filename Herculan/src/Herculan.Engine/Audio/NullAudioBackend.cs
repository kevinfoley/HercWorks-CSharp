/// <para>It hands out real sample ids and play handles and remembers nothing else, so

/// newest-handle bookkeeping — exactly as it would with a device attached. That is what makes those

/// <para><see cref="IsPlaying"/> always answers false, which is the one behavioural difference:
/// a finite repeat count completes immediately instead of after the sample's length. Channels are
