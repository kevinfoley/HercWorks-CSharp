/// <para><b>The canvas is the mechanism behind the heads-down pan.</b> DBSIM's cockpit lives in a
/// virtual space taller than the screen — 320x480 in the low-res mode, 640x960 in the two 640x480
/// modes — and each view is a screen-sized window into it at that view's own origin.
/// <c>Sim_InitMissionSession</c> (<c>004614fc</c>) blits view 1's canopy art and then view 0's during
/// mission bring-up, so both are resident in the canvas at once; switching between them is a pure
/// scroll of the display window, never a redraw. That is why the transition can be animated at all,
/// and it is why this engine draws the forward and heads-down art as two quads at fixed canvas
/// offsets and moves the window rather than cross-fading two full-screen images.</para>
