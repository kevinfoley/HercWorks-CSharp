/// <para><b>Where the numbers live.</b> Unlike the MFD, whose per-herc <c>.GAU</c> supplies one panel
/// rect and nothing else, the whole HDD is authored per herc: the block at <c>.GAU</c> offset 1212
/// carries an origin, four region rects, fifteen widget rects, three marker rects and two mode
/// values. Only the sub-layouts <i>inside</i> those regions — the map's inset, the nine order rows,
/// the thirteen damage rows — are hardcoded in DBSIM. That is why the retail hercs differ so much
/// here: TOMAHAWK puts its comm boxes above the map, OUTLAW and RAZOR stack their two page buttons
/// vertically, and APOCA, COLOSSUS and MAVERICK put the whole button strip below the map instead of
/// above it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Coordinates are device pixels relative to the <c>.HB1</c> art's own top-left.</b> The
/// file's values are authored in the 320-wide space, and <c>FUN_0044bed0</c> shifts every one of them
/// by <c>VideoMode_X/YCoordShift</c> before the constructor adds the block's origin — which it first
/// biases by <c>+0x28</c> on the y axis (<c>param_1[1] = param_1[1] + 0x28</c>, the function's first
/// statement). Every retail file authors that origin as <c>(0, 197)</c>, so the bias makes it
/// <c>(0, 237)</c>: exactly the canvas origin the herc's own <c>.VUE</c> gives view 1, i.e. the row
/// the <c>.HB1</c> art is blitted at. Subtracting that origin back off is what turns a canvas
/// coordinate into an art-local one, and it is the check that confirms the whole block — a stray
/// <c>+0x28</c> reading as anything else would not land the art exactly.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What confirms the widget mapping.</b> Every widget that has art of its own was checked
/// against that art's own frame size in <c>hba\HDD.HBA</c>, across all nine retail <c>.GAU</c> files
/// — the same method the MFD's button table passed. Six of the ten sizes match to the pixel in every
/// file: both arrow sets and both magnifiers, 54 exact matches. The two that do not are the two the
/// original itself does not match: the page buttons' plate is two rows taller than their rect, the
/// same overhang the weapon-row plates have, and XMIT and CANCEL have a 54x20 plate inside a 70x18
/// click rect that overlaps its neighbour by a column — which is why their captions centre on
