/// the latter being exactly twice the former on both axes, frame for frame. DBSIM picks between them
/// at load time off a video-mode global, with the literal folder names sitting adjacent to each bank
/// name in its .rdata (<c>"NAME\0hba\0dba\0"</c>). The same <c>d</c>/<c>h</c> split runs through the
/// whole resource set: <c>db0</c>/<c>hb0</c> canopy art, <c>dfn</c>/<c>hfn</c> fonts, <c>edg</c>/
/// <c>hdg</c> clip regions. This engine renders the 640x480 <c>.HB0</c> canopy, so it takes the <c>hba</c> half
/// throughout — mixing the two would put half-scale sprites on full-scale art.</para>
///
/// <para>That same video mode is what <see cref="CockpitArt.GauToPixelScale"/> is: the original's
/// hardcoded widget coordinates appear in the disassembly as <c>value &lt;&lt; (shift &amp; 0x1f)</c>

/// frames in <see cref="CockpitArt"/> no longer use index 0 for anything: their cutout comes from the
