/// The MFD's FLASH COMM page (<c>MfdFlashCommScreen_Ctor</c>, <c>0043f5d8</c>) — six order rows, one
/// of them selected, and XMIT. Derivation: docs/formats/mfd.md and
/// docs/simulation/ai-squadmates.md.
///
/// <para><b>Six positions, not six orders.</b> Each row names one of two verbs from
/// <c>STRINGS0.STR</c> group 0: its own index, or that index <b>+ 3</b> when the row's state byte
/// (<c>screen+0x2c + row</c>) has bit 1 set. Only rows 4 and 5 ever toggle — <c>FUN_0043f9d0</c>
/// flips the bit after a transmission and returns immediately for any other row — so the page reads
/// <c>SCAN FOR HOSTILES</c>/<c>EMCON</c> and <c>FIRE AT WILL</c>/<c>HOLD YOUR FIRE</c> and the first
/// four rows are fixed.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Two selections, not one.</b> The row the page draws lives in the display's shared state
/// block (<c>display+0xb1</c>, <see cref="SelectedRow"/>); the row XMIT actually sends lives on the
/// screen (<c>screen+0x32</c>, <see cref="Row"/>). The paint copies the first into the second every
/// time FLASH COMM is repainted, which is what <see cref="Sync"/> is. They come apart for exactly one
/// input: an <c>[Alt]</c> hotkey pressed while another MFD screen is up transmits from the screen's
/// own row without the display's ever moving, because <c>FUN_00447130</c> refuses to write the shared
/// block outside mode 1.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Availability is dead in retail.</b> Bit 0 of a row's state byte greys it out and takes it
/// out of the <c>[,]</c>/<c>[.]</c> walk, but the two functions that set and clear it
/// (<c>FUN_0043fa14</c>, <c>FUN_0043f9f4</c>) have no callers in the image, so every row is always
/// available. It is modelled because the paint and the walk both read it.</para>
