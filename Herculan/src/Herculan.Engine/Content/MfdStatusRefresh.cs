/// When the MFD's two status screens, F1 and F5, repaint, and what they show between repaints. In the
/// original a status screen is pixels left in the cockpit raster by its last paint, so what the player
/// reads is that paint's subject, values and scramble state until the next one; <see cref="Status"/> and
/// <see cref="Target"/> are those paints. docs/formats/mfd.md, "The subject", owns the evidence.
///
/// <para><b>When a screen paints.</b> <c>MfdDisplay_Update</c> (<c>00446328</c>) runs the current status
/// screen's update — the subject parked again, then <c>MfdStatusScreen_Update</c> (<c>0043b210</c>) and its
/// paint — only once the coarse clock is past the display's refresh tick (<c>+0x100</c>), and then sets
/// that tick <see cref="RefreshTicks"/> ahead. One tick serves both screens. Besides that the display's
/// full repaint paints the current screen without parking or touching the scramble: <c>MfdDisplay_SetMode</c>
/// parks the new mode's subject and asks for one, as do the sensor dropout ending, a squadmate's
/// transmission leaving the screen, and every frame of a view change (the view manager's <c>+0x1c</c>). The
/// host reports the last three as the first frame the screen updates after not doing so, and as
/// <c>viewChanging</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The scramble.</b> SELECT on either screen writes 100 to that screen's <c>+0xc</c>
/// (<see cref="Scramble"/>). Its next update turns that into the flag <c>+0x34</c> with a deadline
/// <see cref="ScrambleTicks"/> ahead, and the first update past the deadline clears it, so a press scrambles
/// exactly one refresh's paint. See <see cref="MfdStatusSubject.Scrambled"/> for what it hides.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The latch.</b> Each paint (<c>MfdStatusScreen_Paint</c>, <c>0043a5a0</c>) first latches the parked
/// subject at <c>+0x3e</c>, holding a lost one that is <see cref="SimObject.Neutralised"/> for
/// <see cref="DeadHoldTicks"/>. The hold flag's stale arming is reproduced (KNOWN_ISSUES.md).</para>
