/// NUL-terminated in place — and carries them by hand, then <c>strcpy</c>/<c>strcat</c>s them
/// through the <c>":"</c> at <c>004d1866</c> into the label's buffer at <c>004d1868</c>. That is why
/// the field is minutes 00-99 rather than hours: past <c>99:59</c> the whole thing resets to

/// <para>The clock is wall time, not simulation time: the deadline is compared against

/// deadline rather than an accumulator, it also never catches up: a gap between two paints longer
/// than 60 ticks still advances the display by exactly one second.</para>
