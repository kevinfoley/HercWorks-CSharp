/// in it. This one is <b>sized to its text and centred on the screen</b>: the paint measures the
/// composed line, sets the box to that width plus <see cref="HorizontalPadding"/> on each side, and
/// centres the pair on the screen's midline every time it draws. Only the authored rect's vertical
/// half survives — the box's y pair is the <c>.GAU</c>'s, its x pair is recomputed.</para>

/// the fill. That subtraction is raw palette arithmetic on the already-resolved index, not a second
/// <c>COLORS.DAT</c> id, and it is what puts a yellow frame (palette 13) around slot 0's green
