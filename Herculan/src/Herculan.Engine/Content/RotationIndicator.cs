/// The manual's <b>Rotation Indicator</b>: the sliding bar across the top of the front-window HUD
/// that shows how far the turret is turned off centre, green while it is centred and yellow once it
/// is not.
///
/// <para>Reverse-engineered from <c>Gau_RovingGunsightWidget</c> (<c>0043c7d8</c>), which builds it
/// as one of the gunsight complex's children, its class constructor <c>FUN_0043b438</c>, the shared
/// slide-bar base <c>FUN_0043b378</c> and the paint at <c>FUN_0043b4a4</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Where it comes from.</b> Not a <c>.GAU</c> rect of its own. The complex reads the rect
/// at offset 1104 — <see cref="HTorsoTwist"/>, which is really the heading tape's box — and derives
/// this bar from it with literals in the constructor: <c>+15, -10</c> from the rect's top-left, 90
/// wide and 4 tall. Every retail file puts that rect at <c>100,y - 220,y+17</c>, so the bar lands
/// horizontally centred on the 320-wide HUD.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What it shows.</b> <c>Player_PerFrameCockpitUpdate</c> (<c>0041b130</c>) hands the
/// gunsight complex the machine's heading, twist angle and pitch angle each frame, and the complex
/// forwards each one's <i>delta</i> to a child. This is the twist angle's child, so its value tracks
/// <c>mech+0x298</c> exactly, clamped to the <see cref="Limit"/> its constructor is given — wider
/// than any retail herc's own twist limit of 14000, so the bar never actually reaches its end
/// stops.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Units.</b> Device pixels, the 640-wide space the sprite banks and the rest of the
/// cockpit art live in: the loader shifts the whole <c>.GAU</c> block by the video mode's coordinate
/// shift, and the constructor's own literals are shifted the same way where they are applied.</para>
