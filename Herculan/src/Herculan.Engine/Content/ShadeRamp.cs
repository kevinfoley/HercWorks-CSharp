/// <summary>
/// The theater's colour ramp, <c>rmp\WORLD&lt;n&gt;.RMP</c> — the table every flat-shaded face in the
/// original passes its colour through before it reaches the framebuffer.
///
/// <para><b>Layout</b> — parsed by <see cref="TerrainRampFile"/> in HercWorks.Core, which carries
/// the format writeup. In short: <c>int32 shadeLevels</c>, <c>int32 depthSlices</c>, then
/// <c>depthSlices * shadeLevels * 256</c> bytes, reading 32 and 12 in every retail file. A row is
/// 256 palette bytes — "this colour, at this brightness" — so the whole file is one colour ramp per
/// palette index, sampled 32 ways for light and 12 ways for distance. Hue is preserved throughout,
/// which is what makes it a ramp rather than a remap.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The rows are not a 0..1 fade</b> — an earlier reading of this file said row <c>0</c> was
/// near black and row <c>31</c> full brightness, and both halves are wrong. Measured against
/// <c>WORLD0</c>'s own palette (luminance out over luminance in, summed across the palette), row
/// <c>0</c> lands at <b>0.36x</b> the source colour and row <c>31</c> at <b>1.16x</b> — the ramp
/// brightens as well as darkens, and passes through unity around row 23. That matters wherever the
/// engine substitutes a multiply for the lookup: the neutral row is not the top one.
/// <see cref="Render.ShadeBrightness"/> is that curve, measured per theater at load.</para>
///
/// <para>The consumer is <c>FUN_00468054</c>, which is the whole of the address arithmetic:</para>
/// <code>
/// row = ((shade * (shadeLevels - 1) + depthBias) &amp; ~0xFF) + rampBase
/// </code>
/// <para>with <c>depthBias</c> a whole number of 8192-byte depth slices that
/// <c>Raster_SetDepthFadeFromDistance(distance)</c> sets from how far the object being drawn is —
/// zero for anything inside half the visibility range, climbing to the last slice at the far edge.
/// That is the original's distance fog. <see cref="DepthSliceFor"/> is that calculation and
/// <see cref="FogColor"/> is where it ends up.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Who gets faded.</b> The setter has exactly three callers in DBSIM:
/// <c>Terrain_DrawCellQuad</c> per terrain cell, <c>FUN_0042876c</c> per drawn object from that
/// object's own range, and <c>maybe_TSShapeInstance_PrepareRenderContext</c> with zero. The third
/// belongs to DBSIM's other, parallel render implementation (the <c>0042xxxx</c> one) and is not on
/// the path of the poly renderers the DTS type registry actually points at, so it does not reset
/// anything drawn through <c>TSSolidPoly_Render</c>. In particular a projectile — which is a type-3
/// object, bucketed per terrain cell by <c>FUN_00428c60</c> and drawn through the depth-sorted
/// entry list — reaches <c>FUN_0042876c</c> and is faded from its own range like anything else. A
/// flat solid face is <i>not</i> pinned to row 15 at distance.</para>
///
/// <para>The engine renders that fade as per-pixel haze in <see cref="Render.SceneRenderer"/>
/// rather than as a ramp row, so <see cref="Lookup"/>'s two-argument form reads slice zero and the
/// haze supplies the rest. The difference is that the original's is per object and quantised to
/// twelve steps where the haze is continuous.</para>
