/// <c>FUN_0043b950</c>. The complex feeds it a 38-byte state block once a frame
/// (<c>Gunsight_SetValues</c>, <c>0043d98c</c>) that <c>FUN_0043d6dc</c> has just filled from
/// <c>CockpitView+0x26c</c>..<c>+0x27e</c> — the selected object, its world aim point, and the
/// component the targeting computer has picked out of it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Everything is measured from the reticle point</b>, the <c>.GAU</c>'s offset-1136 point
/// (<see cref="HercWorks.Core.Data.File.Gau.HReticle"/>), not from the middle of the view — and
/// that point is also the projection centre the herc's <c>.VUE</c> states, so a target dead ahead
/// projects exactly onto it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Two states, never both.</b> Inside <see cref="OnTargetTolerance"/> of the reticle the box
/// is not drawn at all: the crosshair sprite itself changes frame instead (child 4,
/// <c>FUN_0043b7e0</c>), which is what "on target" looks like. Outside it, the box is drawn. The
/// arrow is a separate test on the same frame — it appears whenever the target does not project
/// inside <see cref="HercWorks.Core.Data.File.Gau.HGunsightArea"/>, which every retail file places
/// well inside the canopy's window opening so the arrow never lands on the cockpit frame.</para>
