/// The console's throttle slider, as geometry: where the knob sits for a given throttle setting, and
/// what setting a point on the track means. Reverse-engineered from <c>ThrottleGauge_Ctor</c>
/// (<c>00447b84</c>), its vertical slider child (<c>00447e24</c>) and the shared slider base
/// (<c>004524a8</c> and the value/position pair at <c>00452644</c> / <c>00452628</c>).
///
/// <para><b>The track and the two bars.</b> The <c>.GAU</c> block at offset 1000 is one widget
/// record, not the standalone rect plus four loose points <see cref="HThrottle"/> describes: the
/// gauge constructor reads ints 4-7 as the slider's track rect and ints 8-15 as <i>two more
/// rects</i>, which it hands to the vertical LED-bar constructor (<c>00439344</c>) with ranges
/// <c>+0x400</c> and <c>-0x400</c>. Those are the forward and reverse fill bars either side of
/// centre, which is why <see cref="HThrottle.DetentPoints"/>'s middle two points always sit close
/// together — they are the bottom of the upper bar and the top of the lower one — and why their x
/// alternates between two values: those are each bar's left and right edge. The bars are not drawn
/// yet; only the track and the knob are.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Units.</b> Everything here is device pixels, the 640-wide space the rest of the cockpit
/// art and the sprite banks live in — <c>FUN_004488cc</c> shifts the whole block left by the video
/// mode's coordinate shift before the gauge ever sees it, which is
/// <see cref="CockpitArt.GauToPixelScale"/>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Sign.</b> Up the track is forward. The original arrives at that through two sign flips
/// that cancel — the slider's own getter reads the top of the track as its minimum, and the gauge
/// negates what it reads (<c>00447de0</c>, gated on the vertical variant's <c>+0xc1 == 0</c>) — so
/// what this type exposes is the settled convention: positive is forward, and the knob's travel is
/// linear in it.</para>
