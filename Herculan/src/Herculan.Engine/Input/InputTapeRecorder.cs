///
/// <para>Input comes in two kinds. <b>Discrete</b> input — key presses, mouse events, the stick button
/// that fired and the hat's views — is queued with <see cref="AddPress"/>, <see cref="AddMouse"/> and
/// <see cref="SetDiscreteStick"/> and goes out on the next frame written, whenever that is.
/// <b>Held</b> input — the axes and the trigger — is replaced every host frame by
/// <see cref="SetHeld"/> and goes out on every frame, as the input block it snapshots does.</para>
///
/// <para>Like <c>-r</c>, the file is written as it goes: the bundle when the recorder is created, the
/// capability block ahead of the first frame, and each frame as it is emitted.</para>
