/// Binary angle measure (BAM) helpers — the angle representation DBSIM uses throughout: a full
/// turn is 0x10000, so a <see cref="ushort"/> covers the circle exactly and wraps for free.
/// The scale is confirmed from the damage system, where a mech classifies a hit as front vs. rear
/// by testing the angular difference against <c>0x4000</c>, described in the disassembly notes as
/// ±90° (see docs/simulation/damage-system.md, "Explosive damage").
///
/// <para><b>This is not the vanilla table — <see cref="SimTrig"/> is.</b> DBSIM's own trigonometry
/// tables have been located and verified entry-by-entry, and <see cref="SimTrig"/> reproduces them,
/// including their deliberate coarseness (one cosine entry per 16 BAM). The table here is a
/// full-resolution Q14 one generated from double-precision <see cref="System.Math.Sin"/> — finer
/// than the original's, not a port of it.</para>
///
/// <para>So: anything whose result feeds back into simulation state — object and node transforms,
/// heading integration, anything that must match the original tick for tick — belongs on
/// <see cref="SimTrig"/>, because reproducing the original's quantization is the point. This type is
/// for engine-side work with no vanilla counterpart to match, such as camera aiming, where the extra
/// resolution is harmless.</para>
