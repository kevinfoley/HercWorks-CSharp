/// Port of DBSIM's pseudo-random generator (<c>Math_RandomNext</c> (<c>00492dd4</c>), state block at <c>0x4d261d</c>) —
/// an additive lagged Fibonacci generator over a 56-entry table of <see cref="short"/>s with two
/// rotating cursors:
/// <code>
///   table[i] += table[j];  result = table[i];  i = (i + 1) % 56;  j = (j + 1) % 56;
/// </code>
/// The original returns the new <c>table[i]</c> in the low 16 bits; every caller found so far masks
/// it down further (<c>&amp; 0xfff</c> for the terrain material roll and the explosion's
/// per-component ~51% roll), so <see cref="NextMasked"/> is the shape simulation code actually uses.
///
/// <para><b>The seed state is vanilla; the call history is not.</b> <see cref="SimRandom()"/> starts
/// from DBSIM's own initial state, so the two generators produce identical streams from the same
/// starting point. That is only half of replay parity: a given roll's result also depends on how
/// many times the generator was advanced before it, and this engine does not yet make the same
/// number of draws in the same order as the original. Treat a specific roll as replay-faithful only
/// once the call history is matched too — see docs/simulation/random-generator.md.</para>
