/// <para><b>What the original does.</b> A glance is view command 4 (to view 2) or 5 (to view 3),
/// queued by <c>CockpitView_QueueViewCommand</c> (<c>0042a3f4</c>) and run by the same stepper as the
/// heads-down pan, <c>CockpitView_StepViewTransition</c> (<c>0042a9c0</c>), scrolling on x in steps of
/// <c>0x14</c> rather than on y in steps of 10. Command 6 returns to the forward view. The gates are
/// the queue's: a glance starts only from the forward view, the opposite glance's command from a
/// glance is a return, and the same one is ignored. See docs/formats/cockpit-views.md, "View
/// switching".</para>
///
/// <para><b>Where this engine diverges.</b> Retail's glance slides one whole panel, which in its 4:3
/// frame takes the forward view entirely off screen. This engine shows all three panels at once, so
/// a wider window already shows part of each side window and a full panel's slide would run the
/// strip off the window's edge. The travel is therefore <i>reach</i>-limited: it stops when the side
/// panel's outer edge meets the window's edge (<see cref="CockpitScreenLayout.GlanceReachPanels"/>).
/// In a 4:3 window the reach is exactly one panel and this is retail's glance; in wider ones it is
/// shorter. This limit is this engine's invention; KNOWN_ISSUES.md carries it.</para>
///
/// <para>The speed follows <see cref="CockpitPan"/>'s reasoning: the original slide is untimed, so
/// only its step count is recoverable — 320 columns at <c>0x14</c> a step in the 320-wide mode is
/// 16 steps — and <see cref="DurationSeconds"/> is that count at one step per 60 Hz refresh for a
/// whole panel. A shorter reach takes proportionally less time, so the strip moves at one speed.</para>
