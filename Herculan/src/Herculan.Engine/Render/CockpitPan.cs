/// <para><b>What the original does.</b> The transition is
/// <c>CockpitView_StepViewTransition</c> (<c>0042a9c0</c>), called once per frame from the
/// end-of-frame routine <c>0045fa98</c>, immediately before
/// <c>CockpitView_ProcessViewCommand</c>. The sequence for a heads-down request is three frames deep:
/// a key sets a pending command via <c>CockpitView_QueueViewCommand</c> (<c>0042a3f4</c>, command 0
/// down / 1 up, each gated on already being in the other view); the next
/// <c>CockpitView_ProcessViewCommand</c> installs the destination view's clip block and canvas origin
/// on the back page and arms the transition flag at <c>+0x1c</c>; the next frame's stepper runs the
/// whole slide, then advances the current view index, clears the pending command to -1 and parks a
/// two-frame cooldown at <c>+0x1d</c> before another view change can start.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why the speed here is not the original's.</b> That slide is a plain
/// <c>for (i = 0; i &lt; travel; i += 10)</c> loop that writes the display start register once per
/// iteration and never waits for anything — no timer, no retrace poll, no frame boundary. Its
/// real-time duration is therefore whatever the host CPU and the CRT's refresh happen to make it, and
/// on period hardware most of the intermediate positions were never scanned out at all. There is no
/// original timing to recover, only an original <i>step count</i>: 10 canvas rows per step over the
/// 237-row travel of its 320-wide mode is 24 steps. <see cref="DurationSeconds"/> is that step count
/// at one step per 60 Hz refresh, so Herculan's pan takes the same fixed real time on every machine.
/// It is expressed as a duration rather than as rows per second on purpose — the original's step is
/// in device rows, so its 640x480 mode covers the same visual distance in twice as many steps, and
/// pinning the duration keeps one speed across both.</para>
///
/// <para>The motion itself is continuous rather than quantised to 10-row jumps. The original's
/// stepping is a consequence of running the slide as fast as the hardware allowed, not an intended
/// look.</para>
