///
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> DBSIM blits the cockpit at a fixed canvas origin, so a widget's
/// authored rect <i>is</i> a screen rect and its mouse code hit-tests authored coordinates directly
/// (docs/formats/cockpit-input.md §4-6). Herculan does not: it fits the art by height, centres a
/// three-panel content block whose width depends on the window, and offsets vertically by the
/// heads-down pan — with the forward and heads-down art on two separately placed surfaces. Screen to
/// widget is therefore a real transform, and it has to be the <i>same</i> transform the art was drawn
/// with or click regions drift off their buttons. Both the draw path and the hit-test path take their
/// geometry from here so there is only one definition to be right.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Two nested placements.</b> Each panel gets a GL viewport (outer), and inside it the art
/// quad is fit by height and horizontally centred (inner) — the fit
/// <see cref="Overlay2DRenderer.Draw"/> and <see cref="Overlay2DRenderer.DrawHeadsDown"/> each compute
/// for themselves. <see cref="PlacedSurface"/> carries both halves so a caller can cross the whole
/// chain in one step.</para>
