	/// hide it behind the untextured twin.</para>

	/// <para>A texture poly that did <i>not</i> resolve (no atlas supplied, or a frame index outside
	/// the bank) still loses to the flat-shaded twin, which is why this is a three-way rank rather
	/// than a flipped boolean: the no-bank path keeps behaving exactly as it did before.</para>

	/// <para>Grouping uses a coarsely-rounded centroid plus the absolute normal, so opposite-winding
	/// duplicates of one surface land together while genuinely distinct nearby triangles do not.</para>
	///
	/// <para><b>The cell gate is part of the key</b>, because two cells of one part are usually the
	/// same surface twice on purpose: a machine's body part carries its intact geometry in cell 0 and
	/// the identical geometry moved to one dark ramp in cell 1, and those are alternatives rather
	/// than a coincident pair. Only one of them is ever on screen, so neither hides the other and
