/// <para>This is the whole of how the original colours a <b>lit textured</b> surface. It is an 8-bit
/// indexed rasterizer, so a span writes</para>
/// <code>
/// framebuffer[x] = Raster_ShadeRampRow(shade)[ texelPaletteIndex ]
/// </code>
/// <para>— the light level picks a <i>row</i> of the ramp and the texel picks the column within it,
/// per pixel. Row <c>r</c>, column <c>i</c> of this table is that lookup's result expanded to RGB,
/// so a shader that samples <see cref="TextureAtlas.IndexPixels"/> for <c>i</c> and this for the row
/// produces the exact byte the original would have written.</para>
///
/// <para><b>It is not a brightness multiplier</b>, which is the shape of thing an RGB pipeline
/// reaches for: take the texel's expanded colour and scale it by how bright the ramp row is on
/// average. That is a different operation. The ramp is not a uniform dimmer — it is a per-colour
/// remap that preserves hue and compresses unevenly, and near its ends it collapses distinct colours
/// together, which no multiplier does.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Distance is in here too.</b> The original fogs by adding whole depth slices to that same
/// row offset (<c>Raster_ShadeRampRow</c>, and the span setups do the identical arithmetic inline),
/// so the table carries every slice: rows run slice-major, slice <c>s</c> occupying rows
/// <c>s * ShadeRows</c> through <c>s * ShadeRows + ShadeRows - 1</c>. The fragment shader picks
/// <c>s</c> from its own distance with <see cref="ShadeRamp.DepthSliceFor"/>'s formula, so a fogged
/// pixel is still one sample and still the exact byte the original would have written.</para>
///
/// <para>A blend toward a flat fog colour is not the same operation, even though the ramp's slices
/// average out to about that much fade: the ramp fogs each palette index at its own rate and keeps
/// them distinguishable almost to the last slice, where a uniform blend flattens the whole surface
/// evenly and washes distant terrain into featureless pastel.</para>
