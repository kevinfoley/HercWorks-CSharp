		// dts-texture-binding.md's "TSBSPPart child selection". The rest of this scene is depth-
		// buffered, between objects and between the polys of one child, so the part's own order is
		// laid over the depth test with the stencil buffer:
		//
		// - The children are drawn in REVERSE paint order, each with its own stencil value, the
		//   later-painted child the higher value, and a fragment passes only where the stencil holds
		//   no more than its child's value (GEQUAL), writing that value where it lands. A child the
		//   original paints later has therefore already claimed every pixel it covers, and nothing
		//   painted before it can land there, nearer or not.
		// - Within one child the depth test alone decides, and against the rest of the scene too.
		//
		// A coplanar marking or insignia in a later child wins its pixels outright, with no depth
		// precision involved. Polygon offset by walk rank or a depth-equal test would only settle
		// exact ties; retail's later child also covers an earlier one that is genuinely nearer
		// wherever a part's planes do not separate its children, and only the painted order
		// reproduces that.
		//
		// A group drawn inside a child (a weapon in its hardpoint slot) takes stencil values under
		// that child's own and is painted in its turn, so it stands to the machine's other children
		// exactly as that child does. Values are handed out in increasing blocks over the pass, so
		// a later group always passes over an earlier one's marks; the stencil is cleared before the
