// The 2D overlay pass: the cockpit-art quad and the HUD sprite quads over it, in pixel space. See
// Overlay2DRenderer for why the overlay has a program of its own rather than going through the
// scene's lit-3D vertex layout.
//
// Both stages live in this file, selected by VERTEX_SHADER / FRAGMENT_SHADER, which
// ShaderProgram.Load defines when it compiles each one. See Gl/ShaderSource.
