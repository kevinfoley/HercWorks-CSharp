#version 330 core

// The scene program: every piece of opaque world geometry SceneRenderer draws — terrain, each posed
// segment of a machine, structures, projectile models.
//
// One program for all of it because the surface type is a property of the VERTEX, not of the object.
// The original rasterized each poly class through its own routine (TSSolidPoly, TSShadedPoly,
// TSGouraudPoly, the textured pair), and a single DTS shape mixes them freely — a HERC leg carries
// textured, ramp-shaded and flat polys in one mesh. The builders therefore encode which class a
// corner belongs to in its own attributes (aTextured, aUnlit, aShadeRamp) and main() resolves it per
// fragment. Splitting this into a program per surface type would mean splitting every mesh to match,
// and gain nothing: the classes share their geometry, lighting and fog, and differ only in where
// the final colour is looked up.
//
// Both stages live in this file, selected by VERTEX_SHADER / FRAGMENT_SHADER, which
// ShaderProgram.Load defines when it compiles each one. See Gl/ShaderSource.
