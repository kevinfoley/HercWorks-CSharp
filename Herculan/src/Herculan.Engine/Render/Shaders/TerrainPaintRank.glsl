// The terrain's paint rank per pixel: which cell's ground is showing there, as the rank that cell
// takes in the original's cell walk. SceneRenderer draws the terrain mesh through this into an
// unsigned-integer target, and a ground shape's fragments are then kept only where the ground
// under them was painted no later than the shape's own cell. See TerrainPaintRankBuffer and
// docs/formats/terrain-drawing.md.
