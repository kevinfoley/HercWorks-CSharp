/// <para><b>What the original does</b> is a screen-space blit of a rotated, scaled quad, built from
/// four things — a scale off the part's radius, a rotation and a vertical squash both measured from
/// the model's own up axis probed at <c>(0, 0, 0x800)</c>, and an anchor pixel. All four are traced
/// in docs/formats/dts-billboards.md's "<c>TSBitmapPart_Render</c> (<c>004762e8</c>)". The one
/// consequence that has to be reproduced here rather than looked up is that the projection constant
/// cancels out of the scale: <b>one bitmap pixel is <c>radius / 64</c> world units</b>, whatever the
/// field of view is, which is what makes this drawable without knowing the original's focal
/// length.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What this does.</b> The same construction, in the camera's own view space rather than in
/// screen pixels: the quad's four corners are built in the plane parallel to the image plane at the
/// sprite's depth, from a right/down basis derived from the projected model up axis, sized in those
/// world units. Perspective then reproduces the <c>1 / depth</c> scaling for free and exactly. The
/// squash and the anchor are the original's formulas verbatim; only the rotation's own perspective
/// skew differs, which the original does not model either.</para>
///
/// <para>Transparency is <b>palette index 0</b>, which the bank is decoded with — see
/// <c>Scene.SceneModelLibrary</c>. Alpha is tested rather than blended, matching a rasterizer that
/// either wrote a palette byte or skipped the pixel. Depth testing is on with writes off, as
/// <see cref="BeamRenderer"/> has it and for the same reason: the original submits these through a
/// depth-sorted per-cell draw list rather than a depth buffer, but testing against the world already
/// drawn is what keeps a puff from painting over the ridge in front of it.</para>
