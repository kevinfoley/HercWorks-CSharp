/// Turns a loaded <see cref="HeightGrid"/> into drawable triangles.
///
/// <para>The triangulation deliberately mirrors <see cref="HeightGrid.HeightAtWorld"/> exactly:
/// each quad is split along the diagonal that cell's own selector bits choose, so the surface being
/// drawn is the same surface the simulation queries. If the renderer used a fixed diagonal instead,
/// objects would visibly sit slightly above or below the ground on sloped cells — a whole class of
/// "why is the mech floating" bug avoided by construction rather than by tuning an offset later.</para>
///
/// <para>Flat-shaded lighting: one normal per triangle, no smoothing — which is what the original's
/// per-polygon terrain fill does, and keeps the mesh honest about the geometry actually being tested
/// against. Surface <i>colour</i> comes from the theater's texture bank when one is supplied (see
/// <see cref="TerrainTextureBank"/>) and from a height/slope ramp when it is not.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The light is baked here, not at draw time.</b> The original lights terrain exactly once,
/// at zone load: <c>Terrain_BuildSurface</c> walks every cell, normalises its two face normals to
/// length <c>0x800</c> and stores a shade byte per triangle in the cell itself (<c>+0xd</c> near,
/// <c>+0xe</c> far). <c>Terrain_DrawCellQuad</c> then hands that byte straight to the span setup as
/// the ramp row, and nothing recomputes it per frame. So the shade belongs in the mesh —
/// <see cref="MissionSun.ShadeFor"/> is the byte, and the shader spends it exactly as the original
/// does, by picking that row of the theater ramp and looking each texel's palette index up in it
/// (<see cref="PaletteRampTable"/>). Without a ramp or a palette for the theater there is no table
/// to look anything up in, and the mesh draws its texture unshaded.</para>
///
/// <para>Note this is the <b>terrain</b> shade curve, <c>FUN_0048c060</c> — not the one a shape's
/// polys use. See <see cref="MissionSun"/> for why they differ.</para>
