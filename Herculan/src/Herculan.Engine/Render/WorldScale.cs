	/// <para><b>Recovered from DBSIM, not estimated</b> (2026-08-13, superseding an earlier estimate
	/// of 200). The original states its own scale in the one place it has to: the HUD prints
	/// distances to the player in metres. <c>Hud_WorldUnitsToMetres</c> (<c>00434228</c>) is the
	/// whole conversion —
	/// <code>metres = (worldUnits / 1000) * 6</code>
	/// — so <b>1000 world units are 6 metres</b> and a world unit is 6 mm. Three call sites share
	/// it, in two unrelated gadgets: the HUD waypoint indicator's "WAYPOINT n: d M." string
	/// (<c>Hud_UpdateWaypointIndicator</c>, <c>0043c3e4</c>) and the scanner MFD's contact-range
	/// readout (<c>0043ebe0</c>/<c>0043eecc</c>). Both feed it a raw difference of two world
	/// positions, so its input really is world units. See docs/engine/planning.md, "World scale —
	/// recovered".</para>
	///
	/// <para>Note the original's own displayed distance is coarse in two ways this constant is not:
	/// the integer divide quantises it to multiples of 6 m, and the distance itself is the
	/// octagonal <c>max + min/2</c> approximation (<c>Math_FastMagnitude2D</c>), which overshoots a
	/// true diagonal by up to ~12%. Neither affects the scale factor; both are display behaviour to
	/// reproduce if a HUD is ever built.</para>

	/// <c>400</c>. A correction expressed in the same numbers as the model's own coordinates is a
	/// 1:1 unit relationship.</item>
	/// <item><c>AiAimTargOffset</c> — how high up a target the AI aims — tracks model height across
	/// the fleet (OUTLAW 1500 against a 1700-unit model, everything larger 2500 against 2030–2575).

	/// 10.4 m). That gap is bounding box versus quoted stature — a model's box includes raised
	/// weapon arms and antennae — not a unit mismatch; the ordering by class matches exactly and
	/// nothing in the load path scales a model (<c>MechType_InitOne</c> hands DTS points straight to
