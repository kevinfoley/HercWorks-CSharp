/// <para>Both numbers come out of <c>Terrain_DrawCellQuad</c>, which per cell installs the
/// visibility range as <c>grid[+0x10c] &lt;&lt; grid[+0x108]</c> — the view radius in cells scaled
/// to world units (<see cref="HeightGrid.VisibilityRange"/>) — and then fades against it through
/// <c>Raster_SetDepthFadeFromDistance</c>, which is flat until half the range and saturated at it
/// (<see cref="ShadeRamp.DepthSliceFor"/>). The colour is the theater ramp's own far slice
/// (<see cref="ShadeRamp.FogColor"/>).</para>
///
/// <para>Retail zones run 344 m to 1376 m at the highest detail setting, and 6/14ths of that at the
/// lowest (see <see cref="TerrainDetail"/>) — a far shorter draw distance than the engine's
/// previous hand-picked 900 m/9000 m, which was a guess made before any of this was traced and left
/// distant terrain unfogged where the original has it fully washed out.</para>
///
/// <para>The engine spends this the original's own way, by reading the theater ramp at one of its
/// twelve depth slices — see <see cref="ShadeRamp"/> and <see cref="Render.PaletteRampTable"/>. The
/// two numbers here are what the slice is chosen against, and what the blend fallback for a surface

	/// difference is invisible because the fade is already total at
	/// <see cref="FogEnd"/> — everything in the gap is drawn flat in the fog colour, which is the
