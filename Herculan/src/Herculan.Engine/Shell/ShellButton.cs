/// <para><b>Two, though the constructor takes three.</b> <c>ButtonIcon_Ctor</c> (<c>00409d14</c>)
/// stores three frame pointers at <c>+0x51</c>, <c>+0x55</c> and <c>+0x59</c>, and both of the
/// class's paints (<c>0040a05d</c> and its subclass's <c>0040a26d</c>) pick between the first two on
/// the lit flag and never read the third. So a button has an unlit and a lit face and nothing
/// else.</para>
///
/// <para>Each is a bank <i>and</i> a frame rather than an index into one bank, which the tab strip's
/// leftmost button needs: its two faces come from <c>dba\online.dba</c> while the eight tabs' come
/// from <see cref="ShellArt.ButtonBank"/>.</para>
///
/// <para>A button's art is blitted at its rect's top-left at the sprite's own size rather than
/// stretched to the rect — the same rule the cockpit's widgets follow, for the same reason: the rect
/// is the hit and layout box, the sprite is the art.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The face is whatever the last repaint saw.</b> <see cref="Lit"/> is the widget's own lit
/// flag at <c>+0x45</c>, which a press, a tab handler's latch and a release all write, and
/// <see cref="ShowsLit"/> is what the paint read from it the last time it ran. They differ because
/// <c>ButtonIcon_HandleEvent</c> (<c>00409df2</c>) zeroes the flag on a left release without
/// repainting, which is what leaves the active tab drawn lit after the click that latched it
/// (docs/shell/screen-layout.md#which-widget-a-click-reaches).</para>
