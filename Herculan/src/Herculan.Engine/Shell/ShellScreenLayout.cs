/// Where the 640x480 shell canvas lands in the window, and how to get back from a window pixel to the
/// canvas pixel under it.
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> VSHELL blits its screens at a fixed origin in a 640x480 video mode,
/// so an authored widget rect <i>is</i> a screen rect and its hit test compares authored coordinates
/// directly. Herculan runs in a resizable window, so screen-to-canvas is a real transform, and it has
/// to be the same transform the art was drawn with or click regions drift off their buttons. Both the
/// draw path (<see cref="ShellRenderer"/>) and the hit-test path (<see cref="ShellScreen"/>) take
/// their geometry from here so there is only one definition to be right — the same arrangement, and
/// the same reason, as <see cref="Render.CockpitScreenLayout"/>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Scaled by window height</b>, uniformly on both axes, and centred. The one departure is
/// the <see cref="Scale"/> clamp: a window narrower than 4:3 would otherwise push the tab strip's
/// outer tabs off both edges, so the fit falls back to the window's width there and the leftover
/// margin moves to the top and bottom. On any window at least 4:3 — which is every real one — the
/// clamp does nothing, <see cref="OriginY"/> is zero, and the scale is purely the height ratio.</para>
///
/// <para>Both spaces put their origin at the top left with +Y down: the canvas because that is how
/// VSHELL authors it, the window because that is what the pointer reports. Unlike the cockpit's
/// layout there is no GL-viewport flip to cross, because the shell draws into one viewport covering
/// the whole window.</para>
