/// One thrown piece of wreckage — DBSIM's <c>debris.cpp</c> class, built by <c>Debris_Construct</c> and
/// advanced by <c>Debris_TickUpdate</c> (<c>Debris_TickUpdate</c>), allocated from the 150-entry pool at
/// <c>g_DebrisPool</c>.
///
/// <para>A piece is a root of a shape file thrown on a ballistic arc: it spins about
/// its own X axis, falls under a flat gravity, loses horizontal speed to drag, and bounces off the
/// terrain until it is moving slowly enough to settle. Nothing steers it and nothing can shoot it —
/// like a <see cref="BeamTracer"/> or an <see cref="ImpactEffect"/> it comes out of the effect pool
/// <c>Sim_MainTick</c> walks ahead of the machine list, not out of the object list.</para>
///
/// <para><b>A piece can burst.</b> One that names a <see cref="ChildGroup"/> carries a random
/// countdown of its own; when that runs out, or when it comes to rest, it sets off its
/// <see cref="DestroyEffect"/> and throws that group in turn — out of the database it was itself
/// thrown from, which is why it carries one. The throw window is tightened for the second
/// generation (<see cref="ChildThrowPitchMin"/>) so a burst scatters closer than the throw that made
/// it. A piece with no child group never bursts and lives until it settles.</para>
///
/// <para>Two things spawn one: a <see cref="DebrisGroup"/> through
/// <see cref="SimWorld.SpawnDebris"/>, and a weapon mount shot off its hardpoint, which throws its
/// own gun model rather than anything out of a table — see <see cref="WeaponMount.Destroy"/>.</para>
