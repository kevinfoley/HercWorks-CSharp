/// <para>An effect is a <c>dts\EXPLOS.DTS</c> root standing still at the point of impact, playing

/// count the type's <see cref="ExplosionTypeEntry.FrameInterval"/> down, step the shape's
/// cell-animation frame when it expires, and end the effect on the step that wraps the frame back to
/// zero. Nothing moves it and nothing else can stop it.</para>
///
/// <para>Like a <see cref="BeamTracer"/> and a <see cref="Projectile"/> it is <b>not</b> a
/// <see cref="SimObject"/> in the original either — it comes from a pool of its own that
/// <c>Sim_MainTick</c> walks ahead of the machine list, so nothing can shoot it and nothing collides
/// with it. The original's pool holds 40 and this list is unbounded, and the original's owner-based
/// draw rule is not ported (both under Open in the doc).</para>
///
/// <para>A row with a nonzero <see cref="ExplosionTypeEntry.LightMode"/> also claims a dynamic
/// light for as long as the flipbook runs — <see cref="EffectLightField"/>, whose slot this drives
/// from the row's per-frame intensity ramp. <c>LightMode</c> 1 and 2 reach the same code; the
/// original tests the field only against zero. A ramp read past the row's twelve entries yields 0,
/// where the original runs off the end of the row into <c>ProximityRadius</c>; no retail shape has a
/// flipbook long enough to reach it.</para>
///
/// <para>A row with a nonzero <see cref="ExplosionTypeEntry.GroundShape"/> lays a
/// <see cref="Sim.GroundShape"/> under the effect for as long as it runs, stepping its cell with the
