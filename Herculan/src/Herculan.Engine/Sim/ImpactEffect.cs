/// (docs/simulation/impact-effects.md).
///
/// <para>An effect is a <c>dts\EXPLOS.DTS</c> root standing still at the point of impact, playing
/// its flipbook of billboards through exactly once. <c>Explosion_TickUpdate</c> is the whole of its life:
/// count the type's <see cref="ExplosionTypeEntry.FrameInterval"/> down, step the shape's
/// cell-animation frame when it expires, and end the effect on the step that wraps the frame back to
/// zero. Nothing moves it and nothing else can stop it.</para>
///
/// <para>Like a <see cref="BeamTracer"/> and a <see cref="Projectile"/> it is <b>not</b> a
/// <see cref="SimObject"/> in the original either — it comes from a pool of its own that
/// <c>Sim_MainTick</c> walks ahead of the machine list, so nothing can shoot it and nothing collides
/// with it. The pool holds <see cref="PoolSize"/>, and an effect that has played out keeps its slot until
/// the next render-time flush — see <see cref="SimWorld.SpawnImpactEffect"/> and
/// <see cref="SimWorld.Effects"/>.</para>
///
/// <para>An effect may have an <see cref="Owner"/>, the object it was spawned on, which decides whether
/// it is drawn — <see cref="HiddenFromOwnerCockpit"/>. Retail also files an owned effect for drawing
/// under its owner's terrain cell rather than its own; this renderer orders objects by depth rather
/// than by the original's per-cell draw table, so that half of the rule is not ported
/// (docs/simulation/impact-effects.md#open).</para>
///
/// <para>A row with a nonzero <see cref="ExplosionTypeEntry.LightMode"/> also claims a dynamic
/// light for as long as the flipbook runs, and one frame more (<see cref="Destruct"/>) —
/// <see cref="EffectLightField"/>, whose slot this drives
/// from the row's per-frame intensity ramp. <c>LightMode</c> 1 and 2 reach the same code; the
/// original tests the field only against zero. A flipbook longer than the row's twelve ramp entries
/// reads on into the row's later fields, as the original does — <see cref="ExplosionCatalog.RampWord"/>.</para>
///
/// <para>A row with a nonzero <see cref="ExplosionTypeEntry.GroundShape"/> lays a
/// <see cref="Sim.GroundShape"/> under the effect for as long as it runs, stepping its cell with the
