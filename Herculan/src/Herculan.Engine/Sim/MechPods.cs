/// The five non-firing "pods" a HERC can carry, resolved out of its hardpoint fit.
///
/// <para>DBSIM does not model these as a separate equipment category: a pod is an ordinary weapon
/// mount, built from an ordinary hardpoint by the same factory every gun goes through, and it
/// occupies a hardpoint like any other. What sets them apart is one pass at the end of
/// <c>Mech_ConfigureLoadout</c> (<c>004175dc</c>): <c>MechLoadout_FileEquipmentPods</c> walks the
/// finished mount list and files five specific weapon ids into a five-pointer array at
/// <c>mech+0x307</c>, one slot per id. <b>It is a pointer array, not a set of flags</b> — a consumer
/// that wants the pod's own condition reads it back off the mount, which is why the slots here are
/// the mounts and the <c>bool</c>s are derived.</para>
///
/// <para>The slot/id table, why the ids are the shell catalog's, why slot order is not id order, and
/// the shared pod damage curve are in docs/simulation/equipment-pods.md. The
/// constants below are the ids that document names; the last mount in hardpoint order wins a slot,
/// which is reproduced here.</para>
/// </summary>
/// <param name="EcmMount">Slot 0, <c>mech+0x307</c> — the ECM pod (catalog id 18).</param>
/// <param name="TargetingMount">
/// Slot 1, <c>mech+0x30b</c> — the Targeting Pod (id 29), which lets [Tab] single out one component
/// of the selected machine; see docs/simulation/target-selection.md.
/// </param>
/// <param name="ShieldPodMount">
/// Slot 2, <c>mech+0x30f</c> — the Shield Pod (id 30). Read by <c>Mech_ComputeShieldCapacity</c>,
/// which adds its bonus to shield capacity, and by nothing else: the pod class overrides no
/// behaviour, holds no state and has no button on its cockpit row, so the mount and its damage are
/// the whole of it. See <see cref="ShieldCharge"/>.
/// </param>
/// <param name="EnergyPodMount">
/// Slot 3, <c>mech+0x313</c> — the Energy Pod (id 32). Read by <c>Mech_ComputeReactorRate</c>, which
/// adds its bonus to reactor output, and like the Shield Pod inert in every other respect; see
/// <see cref="MechObject.ReactorOutputRate"/>.
/// </param>

/// Slot 4, <c>mech+0x317</c> — the Turbo Pod (id 31), read by the locomotion tick. It is the one pod
/// that draws on the Master Energy Pool, through its own <c>+0x34</c> override.
