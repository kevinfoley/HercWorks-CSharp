/// The Targeting Pod's own state — catalog id 29, <c>mech+0x30b</c>, the pod that lets the player

/// <c>[Enter]</c>, then <c>[Tab]</c> cycles through that target's components, and Automatic Turret
/// Tracking follows the part rather than centre mass.
///
/// <para>In the original this is a weapon-mount subclass, built by <c>TargetingPod_Ctor</c>
/// (<c>0040e308</c>) over <c>0x8a</c> bytes. Its four fields sit past every other mount class'; they
/// are gathered here rather than added to <see cref="WeaponMount"/> so that the one mount that has
/// them is the one that carries them, which is what <see cref="WeaponMount.ComponentLock"/> is.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The constructor writes none of them.</b> It writes the gauge handle and the catalog id
/// and stops, so what the four hold at spawn is whatever the block held — and the block is zeroed:
/// <c>MechLoadout_ConstructWeaponMounts</c> (<c>0040fff8</c>) opens by pushing a 200000-byte arena
/// that <c>Arena_Push</c> has just <c>calloc</c>'d and bump-allocates every mount out of it, and the
/// fallback that bump allocator drops to when the arena is absent or full
/// (<c>Mem_AllocZeroedTagged</c>) zeroes what it hands back anyway. So a
/// pristine pod starts with cursor 0, component 0, no cached damage and an expired decay timer, and
/// <see cref="ComponentDamage"/> agrees with <see cref="MechPods.DamageOf"/>'s live reading until
/// the first hit — after which <c>Mech_ComponentDamageWrite</c> hands every mount its component's
/// new reading, so the two never part company. <b>They are still not interchangeable</b>: the live
/// reading is a function of the damage model at the instant it is asked, and the cache is only as
/// current as the last write. See docs/simulation/target-selection.md.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Nothing here is reached for an AI machine.</b> All three drivers hang off the player's
/// per-frame cockpit update or the <c>[Tab]</c> command, so an AI machine carrying a pod uses it for
/// exactly one thing: <see cref="ComponentDamage"/>'s <see cref="AiSystemsBandLimit"/> threshold in
