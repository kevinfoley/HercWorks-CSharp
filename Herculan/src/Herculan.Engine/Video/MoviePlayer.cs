/// <para>Sound is handed to <see cref="IAudioBackend"/> as one sample rather than streamed. The
/// backend's sample model is one buffer per sound, and the longest track in the retail corpus is
/// under a megabyte once widened to 16-bit, so streaming would be machinery for nothing. It does
/// mean a stereo track is folded to mono on the way in, because <see cref="WaveSample"/> is mono:
/// the backend pans at play time and has nowhere to put a second channel.</para>
///
/// <para>Video is the clock and audio is free-running. Once the sample is started nothing re-syncs
/// it, which is right for a cutscene of a few minutes on a machine that can decode faster than
/// real time, and is what the original did — it also had no mechanism to resynchronise a movie
