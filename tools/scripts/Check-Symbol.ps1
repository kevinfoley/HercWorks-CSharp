.SYNOPSIS
Show every place this repo records a fact about one symbol, so disagreements are visible at a glance.

.DESCRIPTION
An RE finding can live in four places: tools/ghidra_scripts/known_symbols.json, Herculan/docs/**,
the C# port under Herculan/src/**, and the Ghidra database itself. Nothing keeps them in step, and
each refers to the same function differently -- one doc says FUN_00467944, another says
CountdownTimerTick, the C# says Math_CountdownTimerTick. A grep for any single spelling therefore
misses most of the copies, which is how a corrected finding stays wrong in two places for months.

This resolves one identifier (address OR name, partial names allowed) to every alias the repo uses
for it, then reports every mention of every alias, grouped by location.

Run it BEFORE deriving something from disassembly -- the answer may already be recorded, most often
in a C# doc comment written during the port, which is the copy least likely to be reflected upstream.
Run it AFTER recording a finding, to catch the older copies that now contradict it.

It reports, never edits. Reconciling what it finds is a judgement call.

.PARAMETER Query
An address (00467944), a symbol name, or a fragment of one (case-insensitive).

.PARAMETER RepoRoot
Repo root. Defaults to two levels above this script.
