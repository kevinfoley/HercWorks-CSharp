"""Resolve every cross-reference in the docs, so a rename cannot quietly orphan one.

`doc_lint.py` reads one file at a time and never follows a link. This follows all
of them: that a linked file still exists, and that a `#fragment` still names a
heading in it. Those are the two things a rename breaks silently -- the target
moves, the link keeps rendering, and nothing complains until a reader clicks it.

**The heading is the anchor.** Retitling `## Weapon energy arbitration --
FUN_004107e4` to name the symbol instead of the placeholder changes the anchor
every inbound link spelled out, in files the rename never touched. That is not
hypothetical: it is how three of this repo's links came to point at nothing, one
of them from a `FUN_` cleanup pass that renamed headings correctly and never
looked outward.

**So there is no --staged mode, deliberately.** The file that breaks is not the
file you edited. Checking only what you touched would report clean on exactly
the change that does the damage, which is worse than not checking at all. Every
run resolves the whole set.

Usage:
    python tools/scripts/doc_links.py                  # check the default doc set
    python tools/scripts/doc_links.py PATH [PATH ...]  # add files/dirs to the set
    python tools/scripts/doc_links.py --code           # also check paths named in C# comments
    python tools/scripts/doc_links.py --quiet          # summary only

Exit status is 1 when anything is broken, so it works as a pre-commit hook.

It checks relative links only. An `http(s)://` or `mailto:` target is somebody
else's to keep alive, and a bare `#fragment` is resolved against its own file.
