"""The known-symbols files, one per binary: tools/ghidra_scripts/known_symbols_<binary>.json.

Every Python tool finds, reads and writes them through this module, so their location and layout
live in one place. The schema is in tools/ghidra_scripts/README.md, "Known symbols".

The layout the writers keep: UTF-8 with a BOM, CRLF line ends, a header object holding
schema_version, _readme and entries, and each entry a block of FIELDS in that order, indented four
spaces, in ascending address order. Address order is what lets two branches that both add symbols
insert at different places in the file instead of conflicting at its top.
